<seg id="2">Hundreds of people rallied Friday in northwest Bosnia against plans by neighboring Croatia to store part of the waste from the region's only nuclear plant near its border with Bosnia and a main river known for its natural beauty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The protesters in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad urged Croatia to abandon plans for a storage site at a former army barracks in Trgovska Gora and pledged to fight the project.</seg>
<seg id="4">The facility would hold waste from the Krsko nuclear plant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Holding banners reading "I want a healthy future" and "Stop - the Una (river) needs us," Bosnians they said a nuclear waste facility could endanger the Una River and the lives of around 250,000 area residents.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have to say NO!</seg>
<seg id="7">Miroslav Drljaca, the head of Novi Grad municipality told the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="8">We must fight to preserve our way of life and our Una.</seg>
<seg id="9">Located in Slovenia, the 1980s" Krsko plant is owned jointly by Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Officials from the two countries are set to meet next week to discuss additional waste storage facilities.</seg>
<seg id="11">Croatia's state HRT television reported Friday that Croatia was yet to decide whether it would build storage of its own or pay to store its share of waste at a new facility Slovenia is building.</seg>
<seg id="12">Croatian Minister of Environment Protection and Energy Tomislav Coric told the broadcaster that Croatia also has a problem disposing of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and was hoping to find an overall solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from all sides of the country's ethnic divide insisted that Croatia find another location in a part of the country nearer to the nuclear.</seg>
<seg id="14">"How come that out of entire Croatia, the best is the Trgovska Gora pocket that is in Bosnia's pants?" asked Drljaca.</seg>
<seg id="15">We must not let them humiliate us!</seg>

<seg id="1">What is Munchhausen's by proxy mentioned in The Politician on Netflix?</seg>
<seg id="2">The condition means carers or parents pretend their child is ill when they are healthy.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Politican hits Netflix today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The show tells the story of Payton Hobart who wants to be President of the United States of America - but first, he has to be student body president at his high school.</seg>
<seg id="5">Made by American Horror Story and Glee creator Ryan Murphy, it features Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.</seg>
<seg id="6">Without revealing too much for those who haven't had a chance to watch it yet, the show includes a storyline about Munchhausen's by proxy - a mental illness where a carer acts as if the person they are looking after has a physical or mental illness when they are not really sick.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are different types of the condition, including Munchhausen's where a person pretends that they themselves are ill.</seg>
<seg id="8">Munchhausen's By Proxy, however, is specifically about making up that someone that you care for is ill.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is also known as fabricated or induced illness (FII) and is categorised as child abuse.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a rare condition and usually involves a parent exaggerating symptoms or causing symptoms to make it seem like their child is ill.</seg>
<seg id="11">What are the signs of Munchhausen's by proxy?</seg>
<seg id="12">The signs of the condition can vary from case to case but the NHS says that things to be aware of include:</seg>
<seg id="13">Persuading medical professionals that their child is unwell but they seem healthy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Exaggerating or lying about symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="15">Manipulating results to suggest the child is ill, for example putting glucose in urine samples to make it look like they have diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Inducing symptoms of illness, for example giving them unnecessary medication or other substances.</seg>
<seg id="17">How common is Munchhausen's by proxy?</seg>
<seg id="18">As many cases aren't reported, it's difficult to know how widespread the condition is.</seg>
<seg id="19">One study published in 2000 estimated 89 cases in a population of 100,000 over a two year period.</seg>
<seg id="20">What should you do if you think a child is at risk</seg>
<seg id="21">You can contact your local social services department or telephone the NSPCC's child protection helpline on 0808 800 5000.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police Command yesterday raided a school, Imamu Ahmad Bn Hambal, located at Layin Maidubun Tsumma at Rigasa in Igabi Local Government Area of the state, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police alleged that the children were kept in a very dehumanising condition; an allegation the school authority denied.</seg>
<seg id="4">A resident who identified himself as Shehu, a preacher in the school, said: "What they're saying is not true because all the children are there with the consent of their parents.</seg>
<seg id="5">The parents signed a form before the children were enrolled in the school.</seg>
<seg id="6">The parents used to bring food to their children daily and they also know the condition they are in.</seg>
<seg id="7">We were very surprised when the police came and evacuated the children as well as removed all the students' food brought by their parents before they shut down the school.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is unfair because we have parents to testify if their children are kept in bad conduction as claimed by the police.</seg>
<seg id="9">He added that the immediate past Police Commissioner Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to see how the children were taken care, never complained.</seg>
<seg id="10">‎He said the children only studied Quran and nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the Police Command Public Relations Officer, Yakubu Sabo, said the children would be reunited with their parents after handing them over to the state government.</seg>
<seg id="12">"They were kept in dehumanising condition in the name of undergoing or acquiring Quranic knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="13">With many of them with scars on their back which show they were beaten.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, we're investigating the school to know the owner of the facility," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vijay alone getting this much opposition means he is growing, said his father and director S.A. Chandrasekar.</seg>
<seg id="2">The audio launch of the film BIGIL was recently held in Chennai.</seg>
<seg id="3">Vijay participated in that event and said: “In the death of Subasri caused by a banner falling on the road, they are accusing the lorry driver and the printers of the banner, not knowing whom to blame." He also said: “People should be given positions only according to what they deserve.”</seg>
<seg id="4">This speech by Vijay was not welcomed by AIADMK and it is facing severe criticism.</seg>
<seg id="5">Meanwhile, Makkal Needhi Maiyam President Kamal Hassan has supported Vijay's speech.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this context, Vijay's father S.A. Chandrasekar arrived at Tuticorin airport through a flight from Chennai to take part in an event in Nagercoil, Kanyakumari District.</seg>
<seg id="7">There the reporters posed him questions about the criticism faced by Vijay.</seg>
<seg id="8">He answered: While riding on a bike on the road, Subhasri died in the accident caused by a banner falling on the road.</seg>
<seg id="9">Everyone is talking about this issue.</seg>
<seg id="10">Vijay also spoke about the matter, which everyone is speaking about.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even the court has asked why the people involved in Subhasri's incident have not been arrested until now.</seg>
<seg id="12">But it is not clear why the ministers and AIADMK cadres are opposing the views of Vijay alone.</seg>
<seg id="13">When Vijay faces this amount of opposition, it means he is growing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Will your speech garner this amount of opposition?</seg>
<seg id="15">If Vijay's speech faces criticism, that means he is growing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The reporters asked, based on the speeches made by Vijay on stage, will he definitely enter into politics.</seg>
<seg id="17">S.A. Chandrasekar answered: “It doesn't seem so, for me.”</seg>
<seg id="18">We asked AIADMK regarding this.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no second opinion that the death of Subhasri is unfortunate.</seg>
<seg id="20">But why did Vijay have to wait until the audio launch of Bigil to air his views about that incident without speaking about it immediately.</seg>
<seg id="21">Vijay's fan once fell from the top and died while erecting a cut-out for his film.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even that video was released.</seg>
<seg id="23">“Vijay should have asked his fans to stop erecting cut-out for his films by then,” they said furiously.</seg>

<seg id="3">It also shows a video portraying a boy with more than 90 percent damage caused by the rabies virus, as he had not informed his parents about being bitten by a dog.</seg>
<seg id="4">The video shows the boy barking like a dog as he is being treated in a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked veterinarian Anandapadmanaban if the WhatsApp video showing the person affected by rabies behaving like a dog is accurate.</seg>
<seg id="6">When a dog infected with the rabies virus bites a person, it is true that the rabies virus will affect the person bitten.</seg>
<seg id="7">But rabies is not spread by being scratched by a dog's nail.</seg>
<seg id="8">If the rabid dog's saliva touches the scratched area, it may cause spreading of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the saliva touches the wound or injury in the subject's body, it will cause the disease to spread.</seg>
<seg id="10">So as a precautionary measure, it is best for dog owners to receive an injection of the rabies vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="7">When she pleaded "stop, stop, stop," he put her in a headlock and forced her into the scrub.</seg>

<seg id="2">Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good.</seg>
<seg id="3">Francis addressed a Vatican conference that brought government envoys and Facebook and Google representatives together with philosophers, physicists and ethicists.</seg>
<seg id="4">A smattering of academics and Catholic bishops rounded out participants at "The Common Good in the Digital Age" conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The three-day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and perils of artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debates included technology advancements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines, as well as a case study examining the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the carnage.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his speech to the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monotonous labor.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he warned that increased reliance on robotics for the sake of profits risked depriving people of the dignity of labor.</seg>
<seg id="9">"If technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities, it would not be true and real progress," he warned.</seg>
<seg id="10">If mankind's so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.</seg>

<seg id="8">How did his name crop up, who mentioned his name, all these things only they know," Anna Hazare said on Thursday when asked about the ED case and Sharad Pawar's alleged links to the scam.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anna Hazare, a Sharad Pawar critic, expressed the hope that the truth will come out after the ED carries out a detailed investigation in the scam.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The ED will come to know how his name figured in the case," said Anna Hazare, a veteran of many anti-corruption agitations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sharad Pawar has denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was not associated with the bank in any capacity and questioned the timing of the registration of the case which comes just weeks ahead of the October 21 Assembly polls in Maharashtra.</seg>
<seg id="12">The former Union minister has asserted he would not bow before the "throne" of Delhi, apparently referring to the BJP-led government at the Centre.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man who was arrested in connection with the murder of University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) student Sinethemba Ndlovu is expected to apply for bail next week, according to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).</seg>
<seg id="3">The accused appeared in the Msinga Magistrate's Court on Thursday on a charge of murder.</seg>
<seg id="4">KZN NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara told News24 that the case was postponed to October 2 for the bail application.</seg>

<seg id="6">According to KZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele, the 20-year-old accused was arrested on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ndlovu was stabbed below her left armpit and stomach, police said earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's believed that she worked as a hostess at the Msinga Driftkhana motorsport event on Saturday evening.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a statement issued that day, organisers of the motorsport event said preliminary reports suggested that a few hostesses remained behind after the event to watch some of the musical performances after their shift ended.</seg>
<seg id="10">On their way, sadly, one of them was attacked by unknown men and later passed [a]way in hospital," their statement read.</seg>
<seg id="11">UKZN suspended academic activities on Friday, saying "the circumstances of Ndlovu's death requires us as a community to pause and reflect on the fragility of life, and the brutality that often exists in our society."</seg>

<seg id="1">Boris Johnson referred to police watchdog over friendship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri</seg>
<seg id="2">The Independent Office for Police Conduct will now assess whether the Prime Minister should be investigated for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was mayor of London.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Greater London Authority (GLA) said in a statement that the authority's monitoring officer had recorded a "conduct matter" against the Prime Minister over allegations Ms Arcuri received favourable treatment because of her friendship with him.</seg>
<seg id="4">"A "conduct matter" exists where there is information that indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed," it said.</seg>
<seg id="5">It does not mean that this is proved in any way.</seg>
<seg id="6">The IOPC will now consider if it is necessary for the matter to be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The issue has been referred to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against police forces in England and Wales.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was referred to the watchdog because Mr Johnson at the time held the post equivalent to a police and crime commissioner.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Ms Arcuri.</seg>
<seg id="10">Earlier he said that he would comply with an order by the London Assembly to provide details of his links with Ms Arcuri, although he insisted they were "barking up the wrong tree."</seg>
<seg id="11">It follows a report by The Sunday Times that Ms Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, was given £126,000 in public money and was treated to privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Government has since frozen a £100,000 grant to Ms Arcuri's company, Hacker House, pending a review.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is facing embarrassing questions about the verification process carried out before awarding the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Digital Minister Matt Warman told the Commons that his department had done the "usual due diligence" and that the company had a British phone number.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, numerous reports said calls to the number were directed to an office in California, where Ms Arcuri, 34, is said to now be based.</seg>
<seg id="16">PM's friendship with businesswoman 'was open secret among staff'</seg>
<seg id="17">The move by the GLA to refer the Prime Minister to the Independent Office for Police Conduct has met with anger from No 10.</seg>
<seg id="18">A senior Government source said it was "a politically motivated attack" and that the timing - on the eve of the Conservative Party conference - was "overtly political."</seg>
<seg id="19">"No evidence of any allegations has been provided by the monitoring officer nor was the PM given any opportunity to respond to the monitoring officer prior to the publishing of a press release late on a Friday night," the source said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job.</seg>
<seg id="21">Earlier today, the Standard was told Mr Johnson's close friendship with the Californian entrepreneur helped by London's tourism and promotions agency was an "open secret" among its staff.</seg>
<seg id="22">Former officials at the agency, London & Partners (L&P), recalled how Ms Arcuri was given places on foreign trade trips led by Mr Johnson in his time as mayor despite her companies being regarded as "not credible" by some at the time.</seg>

<seg id="2">LOS ANGELES (AP) - A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offenses in connection with rapper Mac Miller's overdose death last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Court documents show Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl that Miller possessed before he died last September of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a powerful opioid contributing to an epidemic that's claimed thousands of lives in the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="4">Walter is accused of being the source of the pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.</seg>
<seg id="5">Court documents unsealed Tuesday say Pettit kept getting drugs from Walter through August.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is accused of serving as Walter's "runner" who delivered the pills to Pettit.</seg>
<seg id="7">None of the men have been directly charged with Miller's death or have entered pleas in their cases.</seg>
<seg id="8">Walter, who is on supervised release in a 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been ordered to serve five months in prison for violating the terms of his release.</seg>
<seg id="9">Prosecutors handling the case, which was first reported Thursday by celebrity website TMZ, are asking that Walter remain in custody while he awaits trial, calling him a serious flight risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">A phone message left with his lawyer wasn't immediately returned.</seg>
<seg id="11">Pettit was charged in federal court on Sept. 4, and his attorney has declined to comment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Miller's rhymes included frank discussion of his depression and drug use, earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hip-hop.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Pittsburgh native whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick was also in a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="14">After his death, she posted an affectionate video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, "Thank U Next," that lovingly mentioned him.</seg>
<seg id="15">Miller is among the musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to opioid abuse.</seg>
<seg id="16">Matthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016 and had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system.</seg>
<seg id="17">This story has been corrected to show that Walter's first name is spelled Stephen, not Steven.</seg>

<seg id="2">The 9-year-old is building a hide and seek game, using a free programming application called Scratch 2.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations, and stories online or offline.</seg>
<seg id="4">So far, Basil has used it to generate more than 30 mobile games.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today's game involves a bat he has programmed to hide.</seg>
<seg id="6">The player gets a point every time he catches the bat when it emerges from its hiding place.</seg>
<seg id="7">I learned how to build games at a boot camp.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Now, I build to keep me busy when I am bored," Basil told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="9">In March, his father signed him up for a five-day boot camp for children aged 5 to 15.</seg>
<seg id="10">The camp, organized by Codefest International, was put in place to give children like Basil access to emerging technologies like robotics and virtual reality.</seg>
<seg id="11">Growing up, Basil used to play a lot of mobile games says his father, Basil Okpara Sr.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I bought him a tablet when he was 4 years old because I saw that he was always grabbing phones to play games with.</seg>
<seg id="13">He played Candy Crush and Temple Run a lot," the father told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Basil's interest in creating his games grew at age 7 after he got scolded for spending all of his time playing.</seg>
<seg id="15">"There was this day he was on the tablet, as usual, he was so carried away with the game he was playing that I got upset with him," his father said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Out of annoyance, I said to him, 'you are always playing games, can't you think about building your own games so others can play yours too?'.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was angry when I said it, and I did not know he took it seriously," he added.</seg>
<seg id="18">Since then, Basil actively showed interest in learning how to make his own games, prompting his parents to buy him a laptop and register him to learn the first steps of building games.</seg>
<seg id="19">Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, titles his games based on what they are about.</seg>
<seg id="20">One of his games, 'Mosquito mash' is available on Google play store.</seg>
<seg id="21">Africa has the largest youth population in the world, and like Basil, this population is taking the lead when it comes to innovation on the continent.</seg>
<seg id="22">Two Nigerian 12-year-olds were recently celebrated for using codes to build robots to sort out their house chores.</seg>
<seg id="23">In May, team Acrobot, a Ghanaian all-girls high school team won the 2019 Robofest competition by programming robots to stack boxes.</seg>
<seg id="24">And with Africa experiencing increased investment from tech giants like Google and Microsoft, Basil and his peers are on their way to becoming future coding stars.</seg>

<seg id="13">The court documents filed Friday state that Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he had never had conversations with Causey about staff at the state Department of Insurance.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Hayes had in fact spoken to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request to make personnel changes within the regulator's agency, according to the factual basis document.</seg>
<seg id="15">Prosecutors have said that Hayes also helped Lindberg request a meeting with Causey and that Hayes discussed the bribe directly with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="16">An indictment unsealed in April alleges that Lindberg wanted special treatment for his insurance businesses and planned to funnel up to $2 million for Causey's 2020 reelection campaign.</seg>
<seg id="17">The scheme involved a request to replace a department official who had been examining a Lindberg company, according to the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="18">Causey, a Republican, reported the alleged attempted bribe to federal investigators and helped them build their case.</seg>
<seg id="19">He faces no charges.</seg>
<seg id="20">The indictment states that an associate of Lindberg's directed Hayes to transfer $250,000 to Causey's reelection campaign during a conversation that also included Lindberg and Causey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hayes initially protested, saying that moving so much money would draw attention, but eventually relented during the conversation, according to the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Whatever you all want to do, we'll do," Hayes said, according to the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Alright, I'll get "er done."</seg>
<seg id="24">A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor's office didn't respond to an email seeking further information about the plea agreement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Facebook to hide number of likes in trial aimed at improving users' wellbeing</seg>
<seg id="2">Some Facebook users will soon no longer see the number of likes, reactions and video views on other's posts in a world-first trial aimed at boosting users' wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Instead, likes will be private and only visible to the post's author in a change that follows a similar test on Instagram which started in July in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new Facebook trial, which begins on Friday, will also kick off in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Facebook Australia's director of policy Mia Garlick said the change was based on wellbeing research and feedback from mental health professionals that the number of likes can cause social comparison.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We've had really positive feedback from a lot of the anti-bullying groups and mental health organisations that we work with," Garlick said.</seg>
<seg id="7">It really is just taking that number out of the equation, so that people can focus on the quality of their interactions and the quality of the content rather than on the number of likes or reactions.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's hoped that people will be more comfortable with sharing on the platform rather than feeling like it's a competition, she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Garlick assured businesses who rely on Facebook they will still receive all the same metrics and insights they previously accessed.</seg>
<seg id="10">She said it was too early to say if the test would roll out to other countries like Instagram's trial has in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="11">As with Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, there is no indication of when the trial will end or if the change will be made permanent.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have had some initial positive feedback from the public about the experience [on Instagram], but we're still just learning and listening to feedback at this stage," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">On being the world's training ground Garlick said Australia has very active "tech-savvy" users of Facebook and Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="14">We think this is a great country where we can get some really good feedback about whether this is a valuable experience for people on our services or not.</seg>

<seg id="2">The sacrifice of parents in raising their children cannot be measured.</seg>
<seg id="3">As per the shastras, just as helping them during their lifetime is needed, they should continue to be grateful even after their death.</seg>
<seg id="4">For this they have created rites for their dead ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="5">These are called many names, such as tharpanam, ancestral duties and ancestral rites.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since this needs to be done with due diligence (carefully without forgetting) with sense of gratitude on the ritual date of the month in which they were dead, this is also called chirartham.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is mentioned in Thiruvalluvar's Thirukkural as by dutiful house holders aid, God, manes, kin, self and guests are served.</seg>
<seg id="8">The kin mentioned here refers to dead ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the world of the ancestors is in the south, their world is referred to as the southern world.</seg>
<seg id="10">Though there are many days earmarked for offering rituals, it essential to offer rituals at least on the new moon day every month.</seg>
<seg id="11">A few people offer their rituals only in the Tamil months of Thai and Aadi.</seg>
<seg id="12">In case you have not offered anything to the dead ancestors so far, it is very auspicious to start it on Mahalaya new moon day.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is believed that all our ancestors visit our Earth together then.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sesame, water, replicas of our body, rice, bananas and meals are used for offerings.</seg>
<seg id="15">The shastras say that these will be eaten by the angels and they will hand them over to our ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is believed that the ancestors who visit the Earth to see their children return back to their world on that day.</seg>
<seg id="17">Having a bath on the banks of theerthas on that, and sending them off by worshipping them will keep the family wealthy and will help the offsprings to survive for generations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why can't we provide a separate reservation for government schools in government medical colleges, Madras High Court has asked the government of Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="2">Since 207 seats allotted for non-resident Indians in private medical colleges in Tamil Nadu are vacant, they were handed over to the concerned colleges as management quota seats.</seg>
<seg id="3">A person named Dheeran has filed a case in High court of Madras seeking to fill these seats through proper counselling.</seg>
<seg id="4">This case came for hearing before a bench comprising justices Kirubakaran and Velmurugan.</seg>
<seg id="5">The lawyer V.P. Raman who appeared on behalf of the Indian Medical council said in his argument, after three phases of counselling, if there is any vacancy of the seats allotted for non-resident Indians, a list will be sent in the ratio of 10 students per seat to the concerned college.</seg>
<seg id="6">The college has to fill that list based on appropriate rules.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it is not known it was filled based on that list.</seg>
<seg id="8">The additional general solicitor Arvinth Pandiyan in his argument said that only the list regarding the vacant seats will be sent to the concerned college.</seg>
<seg id="9">The vacant seats have to be filled only based on merit.</seg>
<seg id="10">But how the colleges fill them is not clear.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Supreme Court also has not passed any orders regarding this.</seg>
<seg id="12">So this court should issue appropriate orders regarding filling seats allotted for non-resident Indians.</seg>
<seg id="13">The lawyer Velmurugan who appeared on behalf of the petitioner said that all the 207 seats that were vacant were sold to students with low marks for high rates.</seg>
<seg id="14">The justices who intervened at that time said: "Why do people select private schools when it comes to schooling but select government colleges when it comes to medical courses? Why can't there be a special reservation for government school students in medical colleges? Is it enough to send the vacancy list alone? Don’t you need to check how they are filled?"</seg>
<seg id="15">Government doctors here receive a lower salary than teachers, even less than my assistant.</seg>
<seg id="16">We consider this as an injustice rendered to the doctors.</seg>
<seg id="17">We order to include the 10 private colleges in Tamil Nadu as defendants in this case.</seg>
<seg id="18">They ordered these colleges to submit details regarding the list of students admitted in the seats allotted for non-resident Indians and the marks scored by them before 15th October.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brother Jailed For Life For Pakistan Social Media Star Qandeel Baloch's Honour Killing</seg>
<seg id="2">Qandeel Baloch, who shot to fame for her social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.</seg>
<seg id="3">The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was on Friday convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison in the patriarchal country's highest-profile "honour killing."</seg>
<seg id="4">Baloch, who shot to fame for her risque selfies -- tame by Western standards, but considered provocative in deeply misogynistic Pakistan -- was strangled in July 2016.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="6">Days later he told a press conference that he had no remorse over what he did, saying that "of course" he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour had been "intolerable."</seg>
<seg id="7">His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP the court in the eastern city of Multan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, in a long-awaited verdict.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Inshallah (God willing), he will be acquitted by a high court," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai told AFP she had hoped her son would be acquitted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="11">She was my daughter and he is my son," she said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Baloch's murder made international headlines and reignited calls for action against an epidemic of so-called "honour killings," in which a victim -- usually a woman -- is murdered for flouting patriarchal social codes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Women have been burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for offences such as choosing their own husband or -- in Baloch's case -- bringing "shame" on their family by celebrating their sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="14">The killings are usually carried out by a close relative.</seg>
<seg id="15">Under Pakistan's Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retribution) law, they can then seek forgiveness from a victim's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="16">Three months after Baloch's murder, parliament passed new legislation mandating life imprisonment for honour killings.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, whether a murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion, meaning that killers can theoretically claim a different motive and still be pardoned.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Baloch's case, her parents initially insisted their son would be given no absolution.</seg>
<seg id="19">But, heartbroken at the thought of losing him also, they changed their minds and said they wanted him to be forgiven.</seg>
<seg id="20">International revulsion at the killing had seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside the parents, however, forcing the case to move ahead.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of Baloch's better-known actions included offering to perform a striptease for the Pakistani cricket team, and donning a plunging scarlet dress on Valentine's Day.</seg>
<seg id="22">She attracted criticism and threats but was perceived by many, including young people, as breaking new ground in a country where presenting yourself as a Kim Kardashian-like figure can be seen as a bold, political act of women's empowerment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The roots of "honour" killings lie in tribal social norms, which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular, though men can be victims too.</seg>

<seg id="1">Maternity assistance to be given to pregnant ladies in Tamil Nadu has been stopped and has not been given for the past year, say social activists.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternity Benefit Scheme was started by the department of health on behalf of health and family welfare for the benefit of poor pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="3">After registering their names within 12 weeks of becoming pregnant, in the maternity benefit scheme, after providing details including Aadhar card and bank account number to the village and city nurses and receiving a PICME number, Rs. 4,000 is credited in the bank account.</seg>
<seg id="4">Subsequently, before the end of the 4th month Rs. 4000 is provided as the 2nd instalment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rs. 4000 is given as the 3rd instalment after delivering the child in a government hospital, at end of pregnancy and during vaccination the 4th instalment of Rs. 4000 and Rs. 2000 at the end of 9 months for the child totalling Rs. 18000 is given as financial aid.</seg>
<seg id="6">Similarly in order to improve the physical ability of the women during pregnancy, a nutrition kit consisting of iron tonic, dry dates, protein biscuits, ghee, albendazole tablets and khadi towels is provided.</seg>
<seg id="7">This scheme was implemented to enable pregnant ladies to deliver healthy children and take care of them properly.</seg>
<seg id="8">This scheme was very effective for middle class and poor pregnant ladies.</seg>
<seg id="9">For more than one year, the maternity assistance given to pregnant ladies has not been provided properly and has been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="10">When speaking about this social activists say: “The financial assistance of Rs. 18 thousand that has been given by the public health and family welfare department has not been given for over 13 months.</seg>
<seg id="11">This affects the maternal and child healthcare during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="12">This has created a situation of taking loans to maintain the child.</seg>
<seg id="13">With only the nutrition kit given, the allowance has not been credited in the bank account so far.</seg>
<seg id="14">On enquiring the officials of health department about this they said that the central government has not granted the amount for the first instalment.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the central government pays Rs. 2 thousand as the first instalment, the remaining assistance of Rs. 16 thousand will be credited step by step.</seg>
<seg id="16">But whether the Tamil Nadu government has properly registered the applications of the pregnant ladies who have applied for maternity assistance itself is a question mark, they informed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hence, the government should take immediate steps to give the pregnancy assistance which has been pending for more than one year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Worsening violence has doubled the number of people displaced from northwest Nigeria to some 40,000 over the past four months, the United Nations said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UN's refugee agency said the turmoil had created a "new humanitarian emergency" that would require a fresh inter-agency fundraising effort of $35.5 million by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="4">UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch said Boko Haram, the Islamist group that has waged a decade-long insurgency in the north of the country, was not responsible for the latest attacks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rather, the upsurge of violence in the past 10 months in Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina states in Nigeria was the work of organized armed groups.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It paints a horrible picture of lawlessness and insecurity," he told journalists on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said there were frequent reports of kidnapping, torture, extortion, murder and sexual violence by attackers who also destroy homes and steal property.</seg>
<seg id="8">Military and police have been deployed to tackle criminal gangs in the region.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the military is stretched from fights against Boko Haram and Islamic State's West Africa branch, which split from the former group in 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2">With just three weeks to go until a showdown EU leaders' summit, fears are growing around the PM's top table that he is running out of time to win major concessions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Boris Johnson is facing a Cabinet revolt to lower his Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">Negotiators are deadlocked over a new customs system to replace the Irish backstop, with Brussels branding Mr Johnson's alternative arrangements proposals as "unworkable."</seg>
<seg id="5">Senior ministers expect EU power brokers - led by Germany's Angela Merkel - to offer the embattled Tory leader a last minute compromise, such as a three year time limit on the backstop.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Sun has spoken to three different Cabinet ministers, who are all preparing to confront him after the Tories" annual conference in Manchester next week.</seg>
<seg id="7">They will demand he abandons the "aggressive" strategy devised by senior aide Dominic Cummings to try to bluff the EU with the threat of No Deal, and insist he accepts the EU's last minute offer.</seg>
<seg id="8">One Cabinet minister dubbed the crushing Supreme Court verdict to end Parliament's suspension on Tuesday as "a wake-up call," adding: "A deal is the only way we can leave on October 31 now.</seg>
<seg id="9">We're never going to beat the numbers in the Commons, and they are against us.</seg>
<seg id="10">The PM has to lean in now and take what he can get.</seg>
<seg id="11">Being aggressive doesn't work, the Cummings plan has clearly failed.</seg>
<seg id="12">We just can't fight battles on so many fronts.</seg>
<seg id="13">A second Cabinet minister has vowed to tell Mr Johnson to try to push through ex-PM Theresa May's deal if all else fails.</seg>
<seg id="14">That senior minister added: "I will tell Boris to put Theresa's deal back to the Commons if I have to."</seg>
<seg id="15">The numbers are there for it now, everyone is desperate to end this.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's all over for Boris and it's all over for all of us if we're forced to extend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir John Major accused Boris of not taking the negotiation seriously.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a withering speech, the former Tory premier said: "The Prime Minister tells us he wishes to have a deal with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="19">But we don't see him sitting down in Brussels, hammering out an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Instead, we do see him wrestling with bulls in Scotland; inspecting eggs in Wales; and arguing with the public in high streets - for all the world as if an election campaign was already in full swing."</seg>
<seg id="21">The PM's spokesman yesterday admitted a deal was still far off, saying: "No one should be under any illusion - there is a very long way to go if we are to secure a deal."</seg>
<seg id="22">But the spokesman also said the Benn Act to enforce a three months delay if there is no deal was "actively undermining our negotiating position" in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="23">He said: "There is no doubt that it has hindered our negotiating position but the Prime Minister and colleagues through hard work have continued to try and make progress in the face of that piece of legislation."</seg>
<seg id="24">Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay goes back to Brussels today for more talks with the EU's Michel Barnier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lorraine Kelly revealed that TV bosses told her she would "never make it" as a presenter because of her Glaswegian accent.</seg>
<seg id="3">Looking back on 35 years in broadcasting, Kelly, 59, recalled how she felt "very nervous" ahead of her first appearance on screen.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I was only 25 and very nervous," she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I had been working as a researcher at BBC Scotland and been told by the big boss that I would never make it in TV because of my Glasgow accent.</seg>
<seg id="6">I went down to London to meet all of the TV-am team and see the show being broadcast, before taking over at the Glasgow office.</seg>
<seg id="7">I will never forget, Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing the icon that is Bette Davis that morning.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't believe that I was in the same room as a living legend.</seg>
<seg id="9">I knew this was where I wanted to be.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kelly started her career as a local newspaper reporter in East Kilbride, Scotland before becoming a Scottish correspondent for TV-am in 1984.</seg>
<seg id="11">She went on to host shows including GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak before launching her eponymous morning programme Lorraine.</seg>
<seg id="12">She will mark her 35th anniversary with a special show looking back at her most memorable moments and interviews.</seg>
<seg id="13">The presenter said that "passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity" were the secret to longevity in TV, adding: "You have to put in the work.</seg>

<seg id="15">Do your homework and be both interested and interesting.</seg>
<seg id="16">Looking back at the news stories that impacted her emotionally, Kelly revealed that reporting on the Dunblane massacre was "very tough."</seg>
<seg id="17">I had no idea that many of the families whose children had been killed or wounded were watching our live show from Dunblane the day after the horrific killing of sixteen children and their teacher.</seg>
<seg id="18">One of the mums, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked to see me privately and we ended up talking for hours at her house.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was all under the radar, I went to Joanna's funeral and Pam and I have been friends ever since.</seg>
<seg id="20">She added that interviewing Kate and Gerry McCann shortly after their daughter Madeleine went missing in 2007 was "extremely hard" and said that she "really admired their strength and courage."</seg>

<seg id="2">Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga turned down an offer by the late president Robert Mugabe to take over the presidency at the height of the coup as he feared it might be a trap to rubberstamp the military take-over in November 2017, a senior government official has claimed.</seg>
<seg id="3">As reported by the Zimbabwe Independent last week, Mugabe offered Chiwenga to take over the presidency as negotiations between him and the army ensued during the coup.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, a senior government official said on social media Chiwenga did not turn down the offer out of fear, but he was able to see through Mugabe's plan to use him to prove to world leaders and the African Union (AU) that indeed he had been toppled in a coup.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a Twitter thread which confirmed Zimbabwe's 37-year-ruler was willing to hand over power to Chiwenga and not President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, whom government officials confirmed was a senior government official in the Office of the President and Cabinet, said intense negotiations were held at the time over the issue.</seg>
<seg id="6">Government officials said Mugabe approached Chiwenga through one of his emissaries when he realised power was slipping though his hands.</seg>
<seg id="7">Intercession between the military command element and late former president had three strands, according to the senior government official.</seg>
<seg id="8">The official said characters involved in the negotiations included presidential spokesperson George Charamba, Central Intelligence Organisation then acting boss Aaron Nhepera and Roman Catholic Bishop cleric Fidelis Mukonori.</seg>
<seg id="9">Former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor Gideon Gono was another strand after he was sent by Mugabe on a one-man mission with the offer of the presidency to Chiwenga who was the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) commander.</seg>
<seg id="10">The man, who in death more than in life has been described as an African icon, tried in vain to get the AU to denounce the military operation, while seeking intervention by other African leaders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Offer of presidency to then CDF (Commander Defence Forces Chiwenga) by the late (Mugabe) was not by choice.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It was a desperate act to save the situation which had grown dangerously fast-paced; wearing down a part of the late's family," the official (Jamwanda) wrote.</seg>
<seg id="13">But there was also a bit of political baiting which the late hoped would turn the tables, at the very least diplomatically.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recall that commanders had declared they had not, and would not, overthrow the constitutional order, a development which would have set them on a collision with the AU position on coups.</seg>
<seg id="15">The late (Mugabe) hoped the then CDF (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, thereby putting paid to claims by commanders they had not overthrown the constitutional order.</seg>
<seg id="16">The hope for (the) late (Mugabe) was that the AU, which by the way was still very confused by the whole situation and how to fit it within its theoretical taxonomy on coups, would then have no option, but to describe it as a coup, in which case calls for military intervention would then have credence.</seg>
<seg id="17">That was the spirit and calculation within which the offer was made.</seg>
<seg id="18">Officials said Mugabe made the move when he realised that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.</seg>
<seg id="19">They said Mugabe was forced to write a resignation letter after the military had warned the strongman that he risked a Gadaffi-style lynching.</seg>
<seg id="20">Military bosses told him they would not turn their guns on citizens if they marched to his Blue Roof residence.</seg>
<seg id="21">And at that instant Mugabe had two desires, to save his family and also to prove that the military had taken over power," the official said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then CDF and commanders correctly read (the) calculation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The emissary (Gono) of that desperate message was told -- through a powerful metaphor -- that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the sect of camouflages, that is, the military); we are not politicians or (in) political competition, the senior government official said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Government officials say the army had communicated to other military bosses in the region through attachés who were in Zimbabwe that their intentions were not to topple Mugabe, but to deal with "criminals" around him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mugabe also tried to use the same strategy to lure Mnangagwa back from short exile in South Africa so that they could have a discussion on the coup and succession.</seg>
<seg id="26">Apart from negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought help from the region.</seg>
<seg id="27">The South Africans, who were key to the process -- not least because of their economic and regional power, but also because the then president Jacob Zuma was the Sadc chairperson -- refused to intervene, but made it clear that if the army had invaded Mugabe's house, as they were threatening repeatedly in the background, South African troops would have arrived in Harare in no time.</seg>
<seg id="28">"That did not work because Putin and African leaders did not prefer that route," a source told the Independent.</seg>

<seg id="1">China needs strong leadership or will 'crumble,' policy paper says</seg>
<seg id="2">China needs the strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party or the country will "crumble," the government said in a policy paper released on Friday ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.</seg>
<seg id="3">China's cabinet news office said in a white paper that the country's success since the Communists took power 70 years ago was down to the party's leadership.</seg>
<seg id="4">China is huge in size, has complex national conditions, and its governance difficulties are rarely seen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Without a unified and strong leadership force, China will move toward division and crumble, bringing disaster to the world," it said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese authorities have long justified a firm fist in dealing with problems, like the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, as being necessary for national stability.</seg>
<seg id="7">Strong-arm President Xi Jinping, who will headline the anniversary celebrations of the world's second-biggest economy on Tuesday, has further tightened party rule and cracked down on those who may challenge authority since taking office in late 2012.</seg>
<seg id="8">Xi has also overseen a military modernization program that has unnerved the region.</seg>
<seg id="9">China does not seek to export its development model nor want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace and not "hegemony," the policy paper said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Chinese people do not have it in their genes to invade others or dominate the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">In modern times, China has been bullied by the Great Powers, war and turmoil have left a deep impression with the suffering caused; China will never impose the sufferings it has been through on other peoples.</seg>
<seg id="12">China is marking the anniversary at a time of uncertainty for the country, which is locked in a bitter trade war with the United States and faces challenges from a slowing economy as well as anti-government protests in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="13">China will never "trade away" its core interests and not allow its security and sovereignty to be compromised, the paper said.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The threat of trade wars and the continued increase in tariffs are not conducive to solving problems," it said, in reference to its trade disputes with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="15">China is a mature economy with a complete industrial system, complete industrial chain, broad market space and strong economic development momentum.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It will never be weakened by trade wars," the paper added.</seg>
<seg id="17">China is confident that it has the ability to face difficulties, turn crises into opportunities, and open up a new world.</seg>
<seg id="18">The United States should look rationally at China's development, as China has no intention of challenging the United States and does not want to replace the United States, it added.</seg>
<seg id="19">The United States cannot control China, and it is even more unlikely to stop China's development.</seg>
<seg id="20">Curbing and suppressing other countries and transferring domestic contradictions abroad will not keep the United States strong.</seg>

<seg id="22">Similarly, worshipping the things that we use regularly and books of children, after performing pooja and using them on the next day invokes special blessings.</seg>

<seg id="2">Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm has admitted diets are banned in her home after her own personal battles with eating disorders which saw her eat nothing but fruit and vegetables for years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sporty Spice spent years under-eating and "obsessively exercising" while dealing with the pressures of being in the globally famous pop group and she was later diagnosed with depression as well as an eating disorder.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now she has revealed that her own experiences affect the way she raises her own daughter, Scarlet and that she doesn't "ever allow people to speak about diets in our house."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Scarlet's 10 years old now and I'm starting to notice that she's more conscious of the way she looks," said Mel.</seg>
<seg id="6">But I think one of the positives of having gone through having an eating disorder is that I'm very conscious of how I speak around her.</seg>
<seg id="7">That positive language - it's habit now.</seg>
<seg id="8">Speaking to Women's Health magazine, Mel, who shot to fame as part of the Spice Girls in the 1990s, before the rise of social media said that "disgusting" comments about her in the press led to her body issues.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I started not looking after myself properly, cutting out food groups, and my exercising became more and more obsessive, to the point that I was underweight," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">I was unwell and that probably continued for a couple of years."</seg>

<seg id="1">To reduce the risks of disasters in Chennai, Cuddalore and Kanchipuram districts, studies are to be conducted with the technical assistance of the British embassy, revenue minister R.B. Udhayakumar said.</seg>
<seg id="2">Studies will be conducted on behalf of the British embassy regarding reducing the risk of disasters in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="3">A forum for the officials of the concerned department was held in Chennai yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The revenue minister R.B. Udhyakumar participated and inaugurated the forum.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the past, disaster management in Tamil Nadu has relied on relief works.</seg>
<seg id="6">Recently there has been a change in the approach to disaster management to include various elements such as evaluation of disaster risk, risk communication, disaster precaution, mitigation and immediate effective emergency relief measures.</seg>
<seg id="7">Based on this a Tamil Nadu disaster management vision plan has been released.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Tamil Nadu government is implementing various disaster mitigation programmes to achieve the goals mentioned in this visionary scheme that is being developed according to the Sendai Framework.</seg>
<seg id="9">Furthermore, a government order has been released to carry on a field study to strengthen disaster risk reduction and mitigation, under the technical cooperation entered between the Indian government and the British High Commission</seg>
<seg id="10">Based on that, studies were planned to be undertaken to strengthen disaster risk reduction and mitigation in cities with rapidly shrinking natural habitats and large coastal and urban populations such as Chennai, Cuddalore and Kanchipuram, jointly with the technical assistance of the British High Commission.</seg>
<seg id="11">If disaster risk reduction plans are devised based on this study, the number of lives lost during disasters will come down and damage to infrastructure will also be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="1">Video reveals tourist hotspot as heavily polluted</seg>
<seg id="2">Surrounded by the Opera House, Circular Quay, Luna Park and of course the iconic Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour is the major contributor to the $21.9 billion Sydney tourism pumps into Australia's economy each year.</seg>
<seg id="3">But beneath the bridge lies an ugly truth.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sydney's famous harbour is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, receiving around 15 Olympic-size swimming pools of pollutants each year.</seg>
<seg id="5">This horrific statistic makes one of our greatest tourism drawcards also one of our dirtiest.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to a new video, titled Sydney Harbour Above and Below, the waters around Australia's most popular city is filled with cigarette butts, plastic bags and bottles, lost shoes and clothing and even dead animals - all coming into the harbour from stormwater run-off.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the biggest component choking our waterways is plastic.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I would call it a paradox," Dr Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program said in the video, which was released to coincide with World Tourism Day on September 27.</seg>
<seg id="9">It does look beautiful, but it is one of the more modified and polluted estuaries along our coastline.</seg>
<seg id="10">The CSIRO estimates around 1560kg of plastic enters our waterways each hour, most of it coming into the harbour through stormwater drains.</seg>
<seg id="11">"After we have some of these really big rainfall events, the harbour ... it's quite tragic," Dr Dafforn said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Two thirds of our pollution comes from stormwater run-off.</seg>
<seg id="13">But like an iceberg, the problem on Sydney's harbour is far bigger below the surface, with the seabed receiving 70 per cent of plastics that enter the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Unless you spend time under the water, I don't think you get a true appreciation of what is below there," Richard Nicholls, owner of Dive Centre Manly said, noting he and his team pull out around 500kg of plastic on their own each year.</seg>
<seg id="15">I think if more people knew (what was under the water) they would just be horrified.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overwhelmingly ... over half of everything we find is plastic bags.</seg>
<seg id="17">The other 50 per cent is at least made out of plastic.</seg>
<seg id="18">When you look at the harbour it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that we get all of this plastic and all of this rubbish just under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of the Ocean Protect, said there were ways people - both locals and visitors alike - could help to ease the amount of plastic and debris entering our waterways.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It has to start at the source," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have to reduce the amount of plastic that we are using, recycle better and be more conscious about what is going down our drains which ultimately ends up in our oceans.</seg>
<seg id="22">If we ruin the ocean, we are going to kill ourselves because 50 per cent of the oxygen we breathe in comes from the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="23">It absorbs 30 per cent of carbon dioxide and our food source.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we can fix this harbour and bring it back to where it was, but it's pretty simple.</seg>
<seg id="25">If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="26">The video, which was funded by recycling company TOMRA as part of their broader efforts to educate Australians on protecting the environment and reducing the impact of drink containers that can often end up in nature, coincides with a study about plastic and mental health that was also released this month.</seg>
<seg id="27">A new survey of 546 children aged 12 to 18 years found 82 per cent felt hopeless about plastic waste and 25 per cent blamed adults for the single-use plastic waste problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">The study revealed plastic waste was also the fourth biggest concern for parents, with 93 per cent of 551 parents surveyed saying they are increasingly worried about the level of plastic waste entering the oceans.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste but just didn't know how to make a difference, which was leading to eco-anxiety.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tasmanian devils may hold the key to curing cancer - as researchers find a breakthrough which could revolutionise treatment for sufferers</seg>
<seg id="3">Medical researchers found how some cancer cells can camouflage themselves</seg>
<seg id="4">Researchers found the same process happens in Tasmanian Devils and humans</seg>
<seg id="5">The discovery is hoped to provide new methods to treat cancer patients</seg>
<seg id="6">What do Tasmanian devils and humans have in common?</seg>
<seg id="7">Cancer cells that can turn invisible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Researchers, including from Melbourne's Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, have found a breakthrough which could help revolutionise treatment for some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="9">It may also hold the key to tackling deadly facial tumours threatening the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.</seg>
<seg id="10">The study tracked the way some cancer cells in both humans and the marsupial camouflage themselves using a group of proteins known as PRC2, switching off a marker which would otherwise alert the immune system to attack the cancer.</seg>
<seg id="11">This can be a major challenge in treating small-cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and a type of skin cancer known as Merkel cell.</seg>
<seg id="12">'The huge significance from this project is that (in) patients who sometimes become resistant to immunotherapies, we might be able to reverse that process,' lead Peter Mac researcher Mark Dawson told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="13">Existing treatments could be repurposed to switch back on the markers, proteins known as MHC, allowing the immune system to recognise the cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="14">'Potentially, this has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer,' Prof Dawson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">'It's one of the most prevalent diseases across the globe.</seg>
<seg id="16">And we may be able to treat this in a far better way.</seg>
<seg id="17">Researchers also hope the discovery could eventually be used against Tasmanian devil facial tumours, where cancer cells avoid detection in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="18">'Remarkably, exactly the same process happens (in human and Tasmanian devil cancers),' Prof Dawson said.</seg>
<seg id="19">'Thus far it's been very difficult to treat the Tasmanian devil tumours.</seg>
<seg id="20">But if the drugs that work in humans can also be used in Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this may help with the control of the disease.'</seg>

<seg id="3">An artistic impression of the gas giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting its red dwarf host star, released on September 26, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stars generally are much bigger than even the largest planets that orbit them.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in this case, the star and the planet are not much different in size, the researchers said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The star, called GJ 3512, is about 12% the size of our sun, while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of Jupiter, our solar system's largest planet.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Yes, an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, who led the research published in the journal Science.</seg>
<seg id="8">The discovery was surprising because theoretical formation models suggest that low-mass stars typically host small planets, similar to Earth or small Neptunes.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this case, we have found a gas giant planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star," Morales added.</seg>
<seg id="10">The planet, which like Jupiter is composed mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.</seg>
<seg id="11">It travels around its star in a very elliptical orbit lasting 204 days.</seg>
<seg id="12">Red dwarfs are small, with relatively low surface temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="13">GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than our sun, it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet, being only about 35% bigger than Jupiter.</seg>
<seg id="14">They emit less energy, so they are fainter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather cool, below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit/3,527 Celsius) approximately.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is why they have a reddish color," Morales said.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star, while a third planet might have been ejected from the star system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of the Jupiter-like planet, Morales said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Planets are born from the same disk of interstellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit.</seg>
<seg id="18">Under the leading model for planetary formation, called the "core accretion" model, an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tug of this embryonic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gas.</seg>
<seg id="19">A competing model, called the gravitational instability model, may explain this unusual system.</seg>
<seg id="20">"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold," Morales said.</seg>
<seg id="21">This makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear.</seg>
<seg id="22">These clumps can grow until they collapse, forming a planet.</seg>

<seg id="1">The order of the government of Tripura banning the sacrifice of goats and hens in Tripura has created a big stir.</seg>
<seg id="2">The state government itself has declared in the court that the promise it was given during its merger with India in 1949 is being violated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tripura which was ruled for by 184 rulers in 1355 years signed a pact with India expressing its willingness to merge with India.</seg>
<seg id="4">The then Queen of Tripura, Kanchan Prava Devi and the Governor General of India signed this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">The main feature of this agreement is that the financial assistance given by the government of Tripura for 14 temples including the famous Tripurasundari temple will continue.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sacrificing goats is a practice in the Tripurasundari temple.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government is also providing financial assistance for this.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main condition of the merger agreement is that this should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Opposing this, one Mr. Subash Batterji filed a public litigation case in the Tripura High Court mentioning that sacrificing goats and hens with the financial assistance of the government hurts the feelings of the Hindus.</seg>
<seg id="10">The divisional bench magistrates Sanjay Karol and Arindam Lodh banned the sacrifice of goats and hens in places of religious worship.</seg>
<seg id="11">The court also ordered the government not to provide financial assistance for these sacrifices.</seg>
<seg id="12">The court has also served notice to the chief secretary of the state, all district magistrates and the police superintendents inviting their answers regarding this matter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The court has also ordered that goats and hens could only be donated to the temples but should not be sacrificed; all the temples should be monitored by installing CCTV cameras.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now, the state government is to appeal in the Supreme Court against this ruling of the Tripura High Court.</seg>
<seg id="15">The state government has informed that it will appeal in the Supreme Court pointing out that the Tripura High Court has rejected their argument that the promise made during their merger with India in 1949 should not be violated.</seg>

<seg id="2">Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38, is accused of giving meth-laced bean dip to a co-worker.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez, of Albany, was charged with delivery of methamphetamine and causing another person to ingest a controlled substance, both Class B felonies.</seg>
<seg id="4">The charges stemmed from an incident that happened Sept. 9 at a Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.</seg>
<seg id="5">A 27-year-old co-worker of the suspect told Marion County Sheriff's Deputies that she went to the deli to get lunch when she saw Medina-Hernandez making bean dip and asked to try some, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by OregonLive.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">The victim, who told investigators she had never taken meth before, "thought one of the bites she ate tasted odd, but she did not think anything of it," according to the affidavit.</seg>
<seg id="7">When the woman returned to work, she had an upset stomach and her feet were unsteady.</seg>
<seg id="8">She went to a local hospital where it was determined the bean dip may have contained methamphetamine, according to the Albany Democrat-Herald.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police said that another Thriftway employee said Medina-Hernandez "told her about placing drugs inside" the victim's food, while a third worker said the suspect had messaged her claiming the meth was placed in the bean dip by accident, according to The Smoking Gun.</seg>
<seg id="10">OregonLive reports surveillance video obtained from the deli allegedly shows Medina-Hernandez remove something from inside her bra while her back is to the camera and go behind a microwave and lean down.</seg>
<seg id="11">She then allegedly wiped her nose after she stood up, walked to a table and placed bean dip in a small paper dish.</seg>
<seg id="12">The item retrieved from her bra also appeared to be on the plate, police said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sheriff's officials said there is currently no reason to believe any customers were served contaminated food, according to the Oregon Statesman-Journal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Medina-Hernandez is being held in the Marion County jail in lieu of $520,000 bail.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her lengthy rap sheet shows she was previously convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, delivery of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine, and felon in possession of a restricted weapon, according to The Smoking Gun.</seg>

<seg id="3">The duchess and Prince Harry, now on a 10-day royal tour of South Africa with their baby son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a youth reception earlier this week and met Obama Foundation leaders.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Thank you to my friend, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it," the former first lady wrote in her glowing post.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Whether meeting with our @ObamaFoundation Leaders or helping girls around the world seek the education they deserve, she is an inspiration to so many," Obama added, alongside a photo of a smiling Meghan posing with foundation leaders.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, which the former "Suits" actress guest-edited.</seg>
<seg id="7">In their candid chat, the former first lady reflected on motherhood and how it's changed her.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Being a mother has been a masterclass in letting go," Obama said in the interview.</seg>
<seg id="9">Motherhood has taught me that, most of the time, my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be.</seg>

<seg id="2">WASHINGTON (AP) - The Washington Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has dismissed a request to review whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its liquor license over its owner's character.</seg>
<seg id="3">The agency ruled Wednesday that the complaint by three ministers, two retired judges and two rabbis lacked standing because most of them didn't live in or own property in the District.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Washington Post reports this is the second time the complainants pushed for the revocation of the hotel's liquor license over a District law that says license applicants must be of "good character."</seg>
<seg id="5">The initial complaint filed last summer says President Donald Trump violates that law, citing assault allegations and patterns of deception.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was killed because the license had already been granted.</seg>
<seg id="7">The second complaint was prompted by the license's renewal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nancy Pelosi: William Barr has 'gone rogue' and impeachment investigation needs to take its course</seg>
<seg id="2">You never know where we're going next.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, I think we're getting involved in the coverup of the coverup, and that may be something that will take some time to investigate," Pelosi said in an interview with CNN on Capitol Hill.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They will do the work that they're set out to do, following the facts and the time that it takes to find the facts," she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">A White House transcript released this week showed that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate, and Biden's son.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump also asked Zelensky to work with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani on the issue, the call transcript revealed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trump has denied he did anything improper.</seg>
<seg id="8">CNN reported on Thursday that Justice Department national security lawyers were first alerted to the whistleblower complaint regarding Trump's conduct involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal referral.</seg>
<seg id="9">After receiving the complaint as a referral from the intelligence community officials, the DOJ determined that Trump's phone call did not warrant a campaign finance criminal investigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said Friday the Intelligence Committee will decide who to call as witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="11">But she added that she believes Barr "has gone rogue."</seg>
<seg id="12">He has for a long time now.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since (Barr) was mentioned in all of this," Pelosi said, referring to Trump's mention of his attorney general on the July call with Ukraine's leader.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's curious that he would be making decisions about how the complaint would be handled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Pelosi said she's "very worried" about the whistleblower's sources, whom Trump attacked on Thursday as spies and suggested that in the old days spies were dealt with differently.</seg>
<seg id="16">I think what the President said goes beyond irresponsible, it's dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Our whistleblowers have an important role to play in unfolding -- revealing wrongdoing in our government," Pelosi said, adding, "For the President to say what he said about those who may have supplied information to the whistleblower seriously undermines integrity in government."</seg>
<seg id="18">On Tuesday, Pelosi took the historic step of announcing a formal impeachment inquiry over the allegations that he attempted to pressure a foreign leader for political gain.</seg>
<seg id="19">The phone call was included in a complaint publicly released Thursday, in which a whistleblower alleged Trump abused his powers to "solicit interference" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election.</seg>
<seg id="20">The whistleblower also alleged that White House lawyers directed officials to remove the transcript of the call from a computer system that stores them for Cabinet-level officials and instead put the transcript in a system for especially sensitive information.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mr. Kofi Manu, a football administrator and an official of Sekondi Hasaacas has raised concerns over the composition of the Vetting Committee for the upcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA) elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">He questioned the inclusion of the Committee's Chairman, Mr. Frank Davies, adding that he was not happy with his inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr. Manu in an interview with the GNA Sport said, he had doubts the Chairman of the Committee would be fair since he had interest in the outcome of the vetting process.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Vetting Committee should be neutral people from outside who have not shown affiliation with any member and who have not shown interest before.</seg>
<seg id="6">For instance, Mr. Davies was contracted by the NC as a lawyer to write to Osei Kwaku Palmer concerning a 10 per cent payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">He is also a known Olympics supporter.</seg>
<seg id="8">For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to serve on the vetting committee because he has interest," he argued.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Manu said there would be conflict of interest on the Chairman's part if Mr. Fred Pappoe, a Director of Olympics appear before the Committee because of his affiliation to the club whilst suggesting there would be prejudice and partiality towards Mr. Palmer if he appeared before the Committee.</seg>
<seg id="10">Members of the Committee were expected to begin work from yesterday and end on October 4 after being sworn in at a ceremony held at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Thursday September 19.</seg>
<seg id="11">The chairman of the Committee is Mr. Frank Davies with Corporate Governance Consultant and legal practitioner, Mrs. Marian Barnor and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwah as members.</seg>

<seg id="2">Justin Tipuric says "it is time to perform" when Wales face a World Cup showdown against Australia that could shape their destiny in the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="3">Victory for Wales against the Wallabies would install them as red-hot favourites to win Pool D and secure a likely quarter-final appointment with France or Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="4">But if Australia beat Wales for a 14th time in the last 15 meetings, it could send Tipuric and company hurtling towards a last-eight clash against England.</seg>
<seg id="5">"There is no bones about it, both teams want to try and get through and finish top of the group," Wales flanker Tipuric said.</seg>
<seg id="6">There have been some tough results in the past, but it was nice to get a win last autumn against them (Australia).</seg>
<seg id="7">I think they will be chomping at the bit to get that back from us, and we want to make sure we get another win.</seg>
<seg id="8">Before we even came in here, you knew this was going to be a big one.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now we are here, it's time to perform, really.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wales have only claimed one victory against Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in World Cup history - and that was 32 years ago in a third-place play-off when they toppled the Wallabies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And their overall record under head coach Warren Gatland shows just seven wins from 41 attempts at the hands of the three southern hemisphere heavyweights.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wales halted a 13-Test losing sequence at Australia's hands last November, with Tipuric set to be among several survivors from that 9-6 success who run out at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Asked if there had been a mental block prior to that win, Tipuric added: "It's tough to say.</seg>
<seg id="14">Those games are so tight, there is maybe... people would expect there was a bit of a mental block, I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the end in the last game we probably left about 15 points out there, so it made the scoreline look a lot closer than it actually was."</seg>
<seg id="16">If Wales are to triumph, then Tipuric's battle at the breakdown with Australia's revered back-row double act Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be crucial.</seg>
<seg id="17">The 67 times-capped Tipuric has encountered both players on several previous occasions, and he knows exactly what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="18">"They are absolutely world-class sevens," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">When you play against world-class back-rowers you always know you are going to be in for a tough game.</seg>
<seg id="20">Those two are consistently up there with the best in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">You know what type of game you are going to be in for.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pocock is one of the best players in the world over the ball defensively - and Michael is more of an attacking seven and probably has a bit more of a rugby brain to be in the right place at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="23">You would rather play the best players in the world and challenge yourself, rather than face a back-row that isn't as good.</seg>
<seg id="24">You want to play against the best, and you know against those two you will have to be on form.</seg>
<seg id="25">I wouldn't say that Sunday is so much a cup final, but it's an important game for us in this World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="26">Momentum is an important part of it.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you keep on building and putting in good performances, you are going to be flying and tough to beat.</seg>

<seg id="8">Around 1.4 billion people will be affected due to this in the year 2100.</seg>
<seg id="9">Due to a rise in water levels up to 50 cm, apart from the 4 coastal cities in India, 45 port cities around the world are in danger of getting submerged in floods.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since this danger is on the rise every year, low lying coastal cities and small islands are in a very dangerous situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Total panic' as White House struggles to find impeachment footing</seg>
<seg id="2">White House officials were scrambling to figure out how to counter the renewed Democratic impeachment push Thursday, with one source familiar with the situation describing a sense of "total panic" over the past week at the lack of a plan to address the new reality.</seg>
<seg id="3">There appears to be rising "anxiety, unease, and concern" - as one person close to the White House described the mood in the West Wing - that the whistleblower's allegations could seriously wound the president and some of those around him.</seg>
<seg id="4">"There's not a lot of confidence that there's no there there," this person said.</seg>
<seg id="5">White House officials remained unsure of how to proceed, not only because is there no apparent plan for the situation, but because the allegations are so serious that the usual methods the president has used to successfully escape past controversies may not apply: "This doesn't look like something that's going to be overtaken by the next news cycle," the person quipped.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another person familiar with the discussions described the mood inside the White House as "shell-shocked," with increasing wariness that as this impeachment inquiry drags out, the likelihood increases that the president could respond erratically and become "unmanageable."</seg>
<seg id="7">That concern was echoed by another source, who said some around the president anticipate he will engage in more "impulsive" behavior, with pressure expected to build on him daily during the impeachment inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's sparking worries that Trump could display increasingly unpredictable behavior and lash out in unexpected ways - both a presidential and a political concern in an election year environment.</seg>
<seg id="9">With his presidency facing what may be its biggest threat yet, Trump has cycled from offense to defense, reviving a strategy that he viewed as effective during Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">He tried to downplay his request for the Ukrainian president to help investigate his political rivals, to divert attention to actions by Democrats and presidential contender Joe Biden, and to discredit the whistleblower as having partisan motives.</seg>
<seg id="11">But while many in the White House are battle-tested from the Mueller investigation, this time is starting to feel different, aides and advisers said.</seg>
<seg id="12">For a president whose brand is viewed as strength, Wednesday's press conference made him look defeated, said one person familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">While Trump relished questions on the Russia investigation, he seemed to be in no mood to answer questions about Ukraine, they said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some allies of the president believe the damage could be mitigated, with some seizing on the fact that the whistleblower did not have first-hand knowledge of the controversial call in question between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy - a fact which they argue damages his or her credibility.</seg>
<seg id="15">And, as often happens, when the president is under siege, that fact energizes his core supporters in his defense.</seg>
<seg id="16">But one Republican strategist close to the White House points out that the president's base approval ratings are already sky-high - and impeachment will do little to win over new supporters.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There is no upside to having the next four months focused on the president's impeachment," particularly if it stymies his legislative agenda and dominates the news cycle.</seg>
<seg id="18">Another of the sources said that those who were arguing impeachment could help the president weren't fully grasping how much of a wild card his response could be.</seg>
<seg id="19">Worried White House officials have been reaching out to advisers for help in assembling an impeachment response team.</seg>
<seg id="20">With the effort still in the early phases, it remained unclear whether any type of war room-style effort would come to fruition or what form it might take, according to a person briefed on the plans.</seg>
<seg id="21">But there was an acknowledgement that a coordinated legal and communications strategy was needed, with a clear leader able to marshal a public relations offensive to counter the release of the scathing whistleblower report and the momentum its release has given Democratic impeachment efforts, that person said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The lack of a long-term strategic vision has been starkly visible, as when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin indicated they were not going to release the memo describing Trump's call with the Ukrainian president - and then 48 hours later, feeling there was no choice but to release the document, according the source familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is anticipated there will be more pressure now than during the investigation by Robert Mueller, who was mostly silent, speaking only through his indictments. One person who may become involved in developing an impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, Trump's outside pit bull and former campaign manager, said the person involved in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Lewandowski told NBC News it was not accurate to suggest he would lead such an effort.</seg>
<seg id="25">"For the last five years, I've done everything I can to support the president and his agenda," he said, "but I have had no discussions with president and his team at all about joining a team to push back on this fake impeachment narrative."</seg>
<seg id="26">Trump's outside lawyer from the Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also remaining involved in the impeachment efforts.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We will deal with matters as appropriate," Sekulow said when reached by NBC News for comment.</seg>
<seg id="28">The White House currently lacks a lawyer experienced in impeachment now that Emmet Flood, who worked on the Clinton impeachment and guided the White House through the end of the Mueller investigation, has left, with current White House counsel Pat Cipollone lacking that type of experience.</seg>
<seg id="29">One source familiar with the White House strategy said that overall, officials were nowhere near the point of bringing people on board or setting up war rooms - but acknowledge they need a coordinated, all hands-on-deck response effort and someone who can lead a political fight, the person said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Explorer of the Seas, part of the Royal Caribbean International family, is to set sail with a brand new look this summer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Following an impressive $110 million (£89 million) revamp, the vessel boasts an array of global culinary delights, as well as fun for the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="4">This summer the Explorer will dock at some of the finest ports across Italy and Greece, giving passengers a taste of Mediterranean Europe.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, even once the adventure on land has ended, the ship promises to offer an experience to remember at sea.</seg>
<seg id="6">Offering something for everyone, The Explorer's new $110m - or roughly £89,000,000 - boost has transformed the liner into a perfect family escape.</seg>
<seg id="7">Impressive technology means that passengers can surf on deck thanks to an advanced surf simulator or watch a family favourite while enjoying the weather at the outdoor cinema.</seg>

<seg id="2">Congressman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) apparently can't "bare" the thought of President Donald Trump being investigated.</seg>
<seg id="3">And in his defense of the president on Thursday, he accused Democrats of trying to obtain nude pictures of the president.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, made the accusation during his opening statement at the hearing about the whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump sought Ukrainian help in investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.</seg>
<seg id="5">The congressman called the Ukraine scandal a "grotesque spectacle" created by the left and their "media assets" before claiming the Democrats wanted to see photos of the president in the buff:</seg>
<seg id="6">"Democrats on this very committee negotiated with people who they thought were Ukrainians in order to obtain nude pictures of Trump," Nunes said.</seg>
<seg id="7">People can reasonably ask why the Democrats are so determined to impeach this president when in just a year, they will have a chance.</seg>
<seg id="8">After Nunes finished his dressing-down, HuffPost senior political reporter Jennifer Bendery decided to find out if Democratic politicians are trying to get to the, um, bottom of this.</seg>
<seg id="9">So far, only Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes (D) has responded, but we suspect his answer is the naked truth for many of his colleagues as well.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mediaite.com suspects Nunes' clothing-optional comments were a reference to "some of the more salacious and unconfirmed details" that supposedly appear in the controversial Steele Dossier.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's the infamous collection of explosive allegations against Trump compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele that mentions the possible existence of a "pee tape," which allegedly shows him watching sex workers engage in "golden showers" in a Moscow hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="1">There has been a stir as a statement from Theni Medical College Principal Rajendran contradicts a statement from student Udit Surya, who has been arrested for impersonation fraud in NEET exams.</seg>
<seg id="2">Dr. Venkatesan is from Tondiarpet in Chennai.</seg>
<seg id="3">He is a doctor in Stanley Medical College, Chennai.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was a complaint that his son was involved in a NEET exam impersonation fraud.</seg>
<seg id="5">After conducting enquiry in this regard, the CB-CID police arrested student Udit Surya and his father Dr. Venkatesan.</seg>
<seg id="6">The investigation revealed that Udit's father Venkatesan paid Rs. 20 lakhs, made another student write the exam and admitted his son to medical college by means of fraud.</seg>
<seg id="7">Following this Udit Surya and his father were produced in court and were put in prison.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this context, the CB-CID police investigated Theni Medical College Principal Rajendran earlier (before investigating Udit Surya) regarding the NEET exam impersonation.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is a difference in his statement to the CB-CID police and Udit Surya's statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">In his explanation, Theni Medical College Principal Rajendran said that the person in the hall ticket was present during admission.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the student admission was done based on that.</seg>
<seg id="12">So the same person who wrote the NEET exam was present during counselling and admission and Udit Surya was present only in the college classes, said the principal.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Udit Surya has informed in his statement that he was directly present during counselling and student admission.</seg>
<seg id="14">How did Udit Surya secure admission in the college using the hall ticket with the photo of an impersonated person?</seg>
<seg id="15">How it was unnoticed during counselling and admission?</seg>
<seg id="16">These are the questions raised now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now the investigations reveal that the student Udit Surya has given the profile containing his photo to the medical college during admission.</seg>
<seg id="18">The photos in that and the hall ticket are different.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also the statement of the student Udit Surya and the statement made by Theni Medical College Principal Rajendran to the CB-CID police are different.</seg>
<seg id="20">So the CB-CID police have started investigation with higher officials also.</seg>
<seg id="21">The mysteries will be solved only if the results are revealed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Whoever is involved will become known.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mr. Sarath Pawar gave a stirring interview declaring he will not bow to the central government, and also announced he will appear before the enforcement department tomorrow, in connection with a co-operative bank scam case.</seg>
<seg id="2">The state treasury suffered a loss of Rs. 25 thousand crores due to malpractices at the Maharashtra co-operative bank in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="3">This loss is said to have been caused by granting loans to sugar factories and spinning factories violating the norms.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regarding this scam, the Mumbai police have framed charges against a senior official of the Nationalist Congress Party, former deputy chief minister Mr. Ajit Pawar and 70 other people as per the order of the Bombay High Court.</seg>
<seg id="5">This includes political leaders, former executives of the co-operative bank and officers.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a sudden twist in this case, the enforcement department has filed a case on Ajit Pawar and Nationalist Congress Party president Sarath Pawar on the basis of the case filed by the police.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sharad Pawar is a former chief minister and also served as a minister in the central government led by congress.</seg>
<seg id="8">With the elections for Maharastra assembly scheduled on the 21st of next month (October), this move by the enforcement department has caused a stir.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this backdrop the president of the Nationalist Congress Party Mr. Sharad Pawar spoke to news reporters in Mumbai.</seg>
<seg id="10">I thank the enforcement department for including me in this case, even though I am not a member or a deciding authority.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is nothing surprising about this move.</seg>
<seg id="12">I will be mostly out of Mumbai for campaigning in my assembly constituency.</seg>
<seg id="13">So the enforcement department would misunderstand me as being in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="14">I am going to the enforcement department office on Friday (tomorrow).</seg>
<seg id="15">And also provide them the information they need.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is their right to enquire about the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">I believe in the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="18">So I will fully co-operate with the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maharashtra follows the ideology of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.</seg>
<seg id="20">We don’t know how to bow before the throne of Delhi.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Maharashtra chief minister Mr. Devendra Patnavis has denied the allegations of political interference in this case.</seg>
<seg id="22">Regarding this he said:</seg>
<seg id="23">The High Court has ordered the police to file a case in this regard. When the fraud is to a scale of Rs. 100 crores, the enforcement department will enquire that case.</seg>
<seg id="24">So the enforcement department has become involved this case.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is wrong to say that this move is for political reasons.</seg>

<seg id="1">Potential renewable biofuel research could help lower emissions</seg>
<seg id="2">While electric cars and Tesla semi-trucks have dominated the headlines in recent years, one thing flies seemingly out of the reach of renewable energy: airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="3">But a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that could allow renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta in the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences who began this project in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="5">His lab is developing hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes like restaurant grease, animal renderings, and canola oil.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower quality oils in its production, allowing it to not only release an estimated 85 per cent less carbon emissions than petroleum-based fuels, but also utilizing wastes from other industries in the process.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technology works to mimic the hydrocarbons present in petroleum-based fuels.</seg>
<seg id="8">"What our technology did in the first generation," Bressler said. "is [actually make] the hydrocarbons which are the exact molecules in diesel gasoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">While this presents a new option for biofuel use, previously produced biofuel technologies tend to de-stabilize at lower temperatures, which, for an aircraft travelling at high altitudes, poses a serious problem.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The problem with jet fuel is it's a bit of a catch-22," Bressler said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's actually worth less than diesel but it has higher requirements.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bressler's lab is currently looking at two options for producing jet biofuel.</seg>
<seg id="13">The first being a low-risk approach which requires giving their hydrocarbon biofuel another treatment and adding in hydrogen.</seg>
<seg id="14">The second option is to continue work on already partially developed chemistry which would keep the fuel stable, even at lower temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We can actually play some games with the chemistry in our reactor to try to change the chemistry a little bit," Bressler said about the second option.</seg>
<seg id="16">That one's a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="17">The University of Alberta spin-off company Forge Hydrocarbons is working on commercializing the product as airlines and both the Canadian and American militaries are increasingly investing in the renewable option.</seg>
<seg id="18">"They can see [a] future where one day somebody might turn around and charge them a carbon tax," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want an alternative in place that is a fallback position.</seg>
<seg id="20">Currently, Forge runs a pilot plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Centre and recently acquired a US$4 million investment from Lockheed Martin to support the construction of a $25-million production facility to be located in Sombra, Ontario.</seg>
<seg id="21">The facility is expected to produce around 19 million litres of biofuel each year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bressler also notes while estimates for carbon reductions are around 85 per cent, aspects such as how the fuel is transported and produced are reasons for why carbon reductions aren't higher.</seg>
<seg id="23">"As a technology guy," Bressler said.</seg>
<seg id="24">My job is to create options so there can be an informed decision and multiple choices on which to go with.</seg>

<seg id="2">A senior cabinet minister last night said the country risked a "violent, popular uprising" if a second referendum overturned the original result.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Prime Minister's senior allies warned the UK faces civil unrest on the scale of the yellow vest protests in France over economic inequalities and Los Angeles riots in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Johnson said "tempers need to come down" in the furious row over political language - but insisted he won't stop using the word "surrender."</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite his appeal for calm, a cabinet minister told The Times: "In this country we never had the gilets jaunes [yellow vests] or the LA riots [in 1992].</seg>
<seg id="6">People don't think it's possible in this country just because it has not happened before.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now they have a model - gilets jaunes - they have encrypted phones to co-ordinate it, and it only takes a couple of nasty populist frontmen to inspire people.</seg>
<seg id="8">Riots in erupted in Los Angeles after a jury acquitted four white police officers for beating up a black taxi driver Rodney King in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this year, anti-government French protesters wearing yellow high visibility vests - gilet jaunes have been wrought havoc and destruction on the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister pointed to Mr Johnson's warning in the Commons that there would be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system" if Britain failed to leave the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If we have a referendum with 30 million people who vote, and we vote Remain by 66 per cent, that's ten million people who are unhappy," said the minister.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if 99 per cent of them shrug it off, that's still 100,000 really angry people who will write to their MP and not let it go.</seg>
<seg id="13">It doesn't take much and soon you have tens of thousands of people on the street.</seg>
<seg id="14">A senior cabinet minister added that country risked a "violent, popular uprising" if a second referendum overturned the result of the first one.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Johnson has called for there to be a general election to allow voters to settle Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has been reported he is facing a Cabinet revolt to lower his Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with the EU instead.</seg>

<seg id="2">India's monsoon season has overrun by almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collapsing buildings and many crops beginning to rot.</seg>
<seg id="3">Normally the monsoon in north India recedes by the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month has been 37% above normal.</seg>
<seg id="4">If the situation continues for the remaining few days, it will be the latest the monsoon has ever receded in decades, according to experts in the India Meteorological Department.</seg>
<seg id="5">Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain, the latest being the town of Pune in western India, where torrential rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and havoc from collapsed buildings.</seg>
<seg id="6">Homes were flooded and people waded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the monsoon.</seg>
<seg id="7">Other cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad have also experienced heavy rainfall.</seg>
<seg id="8">Uttarakhand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains.</seg>
<seg id="9">The monsoon was also late to arrive.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers braced themselves for a possible drought.</seg>
<seg id="11">The extended monsoon is not welcome among farmers.</seg>
<seg id="12">This amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It is making my vegetables - I've got cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes at the moment - rot," said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.</seg>
<seg id="14">For consumers, the impact of the delayed and now late-receding monsoon has meant a rise in the price in the price of onions, an essential ingredient in Indian food.</seg>
<seg id="15">Onions are selling at 80 rupees (about £1) a kilo in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, as opposed to the normal 20 rupees (23p).</seg>
<seg id="16">Festivals are also at risk.</seg>
<seg id="17">The next big festival is Dussehra on 8 October, when Hindus erect giant, comic book-style effigies of Ravana, a figure from the Hindu epic The Ramayana who sports a bushy moustache and an evil grin.</seg>
<seg id="18">Burning Ravana symbolises the triumph of good over evil.</seg>

<seg id="8">Because only men of Japanese descent were involved, the findings may not apply to women or other populations, the researchers noted.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since pesticides have a long half-life, their effects on health may show up years after exposure.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this case, the greatest effects were seen within 10 years of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="11">"After following the men for 34 years, the link between being exposed to pesticides at work and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant," Rodriguez said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was probably because other factors tied to aging became more important, masking the possible relation of pesticides and cardiovascular disease later in life.</seg>
<seg id="13">Researchers found no significant link between exposure to low to moderate amounts of pesticides and the risk of heart disease or stroke.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Zelensky-Trump phone call: Poroshenko weighs in</seg>
<seg id="2">It was an explosive week in Washington politics, with impeachment proceedings launched against US President Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">For political novice Volodymyr Zelensky, being swept up into a political scandal is a move he would have wanted to avoid.</seg>
<seg id="4">But what do we know so far about the Zelensky-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching effects for the former?</seg>
<seg id="5">Quite early on in the phone call, Trump tells Zelensky that the US is doing more for Ukraine than other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although the calls notes released by the White House is not verbatim, it details Trump taking a hit at German Chancellor Angela Merkel - that the German leader and other European counterparts engage in talks rather than concrete proposals.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was Zelensky's response that has been seen as controversial, saying that he does not agree with Trump 100%, rather 1000%.</seg>
<seg id="8">Zelensky added that both the French President Macron and Merkel are not working enough to assist Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="9">This exchange had politicians, particularly from the opposition within Ukraine, talking on social media.</seg>
<seg id="10">Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine's former president, took to Twitter to say that the support provided by the EU "has been unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="11">In other tweets, Poroshenko said that he was grateful for the EU support provided during "Russian aggression," which included sanctions and economic aid.</seg>
<seg id="12">Others expressed their concern, with Ukranian politician Victoria Voytsiska saying: "How could we speak to Germany and France again?"</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump goes on to allude to military aid and asks Zelensky to investigate not one, but two claims: one into Joe Biden's son Hunter but also into the hacked DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine had some involvement in hacking into the Democrat's emails during the 2016 election.</seg>
<seg id="14">Whether this will hinder European relations, or burn bridges with his French and German counterparts, is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="15">I don't want to say anything bad about anyone ...</seg>
<seg id="16">"We thank everyone who helps us," Zelensky said in New York at the UN General Assembly following the release of the phone transcript.</seg>
<seg id="17">Zelensky is set to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany, and France in the upcoming Normandy Four summit in October.</seg>

<seg id="3">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the White House said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gaynor, FEMA's deputy administrator, had been acting chief of the agency, which oversees the government response to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.</seg>
<seg id="5">The agency has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since March, when Brock Long left the post.</seg>
<seg id="6">Long resigned after the Department of Homeland Security, under which FEMA falls, concluded Long had inappropriately used government vehicles to commute between Washington and his home in North Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="7">A different nominee for the job, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month, after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a barroom brawl.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gaynor's nomination to the post was expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job.</seg>

<seg id="5">We are considering the generation of electricity from windmills at a low cost in Tuticorin, Kandla and Paradeep ports.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this scheme is implemented, electricity can be generated at a cost of Rs. 2.50 per unit.</seg>
<seg id="7">To prevent 3000 tmc waste water entering into sea from Godavari in Andhra Pradesh, we have devised a plan at a cost of 6 thousand crore rupees and implemented that.</seg>

<seg id="2">EL MONTE (CBSLA) - Police shut down an illegal marijuana vaping operation in the San Gabriel Valley Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bust happened at about 4:37 p.m. after police conducting a warrant search for suspected illegal marijuana vape pen sales and found large jars of butane honey oil - concentrated cannabis oil - at an office building in the 9600 block of Telstar Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lt. Christopher Cano with the El Monte Police said officers also found a machine that was used to load vape cartridges.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The process is very dangerous," Cano said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cano, who used to work narcotics, said the process of distilling the oil for use in vape products is potentially flammable.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Simple static electricity from our clothes can ignite these fumes causing not just a fire, but an explosion because it's under concentration," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">And if there's multiple jars and things like that, we're going to have one explosion after the next causing not just a fire, but we could possibly have a full complex taken out with the explosion.</seg>
<seg id="9">A hazmat team was called to the vacant office to take possession of the illegal and potentially dangerous substance.</seg>
<seg id="10">The value of the confiscated products and equipment was not immediately known.</seg>
<seg id="11">Detectives said they received an anonymous tip that led to the search warrant where they discovered the illegal operation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Investigators are still trying to figure out who's behind the illegal vaping operation.</seg>
<seg id="13">They said they believe the person responsible set up shop in the office because the space was vacant.</seg>
<seg id="14">While the investigation continues, officers said they wanted to make sure the illegal vaping products did not make it to the street, especially in the wake of recent headlines involving the dangers of vaping.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is just stuff that they don't even know if they're truly getting what they think that they're buying," Cano said.</seg>
<seg id="16">This could be mixed with other harmful chemicals.</seg>
<seg id="17">It could be very harmful to our community, to our children, so we always caution them that they should stay away from these operations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Elizabeth I's lost dress to go on display at Hampton Court Palace</seg>
<seg id="2">It was made of the finest chamblet silk, woven with strips of beaten silver, and had been exquisitely embroidered in a rich pattern of plants, beasts and butterflies.</seg>
<seg id="3">To Eleri Lynn, curator of the dress collection at Historic Royal Palaces, that meant only one thing.</seg>
<seg id="4">The faded piece of fabric she was looking at, hanging on the wall of a tiny rural parish church where it had been placed 100 years earlier, could only be a lost piece of clothing from the wardrobe of Elizabeth I.</seg>
<seg id="5">Three years after Lynn stumbled across the sumptuous fabric, which had been used as an altar cloth in the church in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress is to go on display next month at Hampton Court palace, close to the very rooms where the Tudor queen may well have worn it more than 450 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a measure of the importance of the discovery that in the entire royal dress collection, only one other item of 16th-century dress survives.</seg>
<seg id="7">And while there is no cast iron proof that the dress was once worn by Elizabeth, three years of scholarship have only strengthened experts' conviction that the dress must have been part of the royal wardrobe.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Cloth of silver," a fantastically expensive fabric, was by law reserved only for the most senior members of the royal household, while the "virtuoso" quality of the embroidered plants and flowers, later supplemented by stags and dogs, butterflies, fishermen and a bear, also points to the loftiest of previous owners.</seg>
<seg id="9">The gown, at the time it was made, would have cost the equivalent of a Tudor mansion.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition, said Lynn, in the 1590s, late in Elizabeth's reign, she had grown threatened by other women at court and would not have tolerated rivals wearing such exquisite fabric.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's a big thing to say, so I have had lots of peer reviewers come and have a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="12">And it has always been really gratifying that when they see it they have a "wow" moment too, and leave quite convinced that we are looking at an item of royal dress."</seg>
<seg id="13">The long second life of the dress panel, recut to serve as an altar cloth in the obscure church of St Faith's, Bacton, is not quite so unexpected as it might appear.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bacton was the home hamlet of Blanche Parry, the closest of Elizabeth's maids of honour who served the queen throughout her long life, and local legend has long associated the textile with Parry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Though the dress postdates her death in 1590, experts believe Elizabeth must have given it to the Parry family or the parish in Blanche's memory, before her own death in 1603.</seg>
<seg id="16">After more than 1,000 hours of conservation, 400 of them spent in the most delicate handstitching using specially dyed silk and fine surgical needles, the altar cloth will go on display next to the "Rainbow portrait," one of the most celebrated contemporary paintings of Elizabeth, which shows her dressed in a similar gown and which has been loaned by Hatfield House for the duration of the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="17">"When you're working with historic textiles you gain a real respect for the craftsmanship of the people who made them," said Libby Thompson, who led the conservation, much of which took place in a converted greenhouse in the Hampton Court grounds - the only space large enough to house some of the palace's priceless tapestries.</seg>
<seg id="18">Looking at the embroidery, on the front and the back, it's given me a massive respect for those who made it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I have never worked on anything that's quite so elite.</seg>

<seg id="8">Following this, we constituted an enquiry committee comprising 5 members.</seg>
<seg id="9">We conducted an enquiry with the two students and their parents.</seg>
<seg id="10">We collected their certificates, NEET exam hall ticket, and identity card and compared these documents with our documents.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the end of this scrutiny it was confirmed that both the students were not fake.</seg>
<seg id="12">Problems like this arise even when there is a small difference in the photographs.</seg>
<seg id="13">So the Health minister has ordered the introduction of a biometric process in student admission from next year onwards.</seg>
<seg id="14">In future biometric and fingerprints will be used.</seg>
<seg id="15">During application, exam and student admission phases, the details of the concerned student will open only upon providing the fingerprints.</seg>

<seg id="2">A press note released by Sankaran and secretary V.K. Balu says:</seg>
<seg id="3">In India plastic recycling is done by collecting the plastic thrown in streets and dustbins.</seg>
<seg id="4">Plastic that is currently banned in few states throughout India is recyclable.</seg>
<seg id="5">In India due to poverty and unemployment 60% to 70% of plastic waste is recycled already.</seg>
<seg id="6">The remaining plastic waste can also be used in a useful way.</seg>
<seg id="7">Plastic waste can be used in various ways such as 1. plastic tar roads 2. electricity generation 3. petrol and diesel production 4. concrete block production</seg>
<seg id="8">The carrier bags which are considered as the most important single-use and disposable items are being given free to the public because of the culture of compulsorily providing free packing of items while buying in shops.</seg>
<seg id="9">These plastic bags are seen openly in water bodies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since these carrier bags have very low density, all other waste materials thrown into water bodies reach the bottom, except the plastic.</seg>
<seg id="11">Unfortunately only the plastics are seen floating.</seg>
<seg id="12">Throughout India there are 40,000 plastic manufacturing industries.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among them 98% belong to small scale and marginal industries.</seg>
<seg id="14">Similarly there are thousands of shops that sell plastic items.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are 2,000 companies that export plastic materials.</seg>
<seg id="16">It gives employment to around 50 lakh in both production and sales.</seg>
<seg id="17">Plastic industries have a turnover of 5 lakh crores and give an income of 50 crores to central and state governments.</seg>
<seg id="18">As far as the plastic industry is concerned, there are no environmental issues in its production or usage.</seg>
<seg id="19">But unfortunately environmental issues are caused because of a lack of awareness among the public about the environment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So we humbly request the prime minister not to ban any plastic items on October 2 and make an announcement to impose strict rules to handle plastic waste properly and to act in a constructive way, and to save the livelihood of thousands of young, small and marginal scale entrepreneurs who are dependent on this industry and the livelihoods of lakhs of workers who are dependent on them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mexican cartel boss behind one-third of drugs in the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="2">Chicago - Just after sunrise on Chicago's West Side, CBS News watched the morning rush for drugs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brian McKnight with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) showed what was going on in broad daylight.</seg>
<seg id="4">Last year in Chicago, almost 800 people died from drug overdoses.</seg>
<seg id="5">McKnight said "probably 90%" of the drugs in Chicago are coming from Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="6">The DEA is focused on a Mexican drug lord named Nemesio Cervantes, known simply as El Mencho.</seg>
<seg id="7">"He is the number one priority for DEA and frankly for federal law enforcement in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, the DEA's top agent in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="8">A bounty for El Mencho is up to $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has helped uncover dozens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="10">El Mencho's Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least a third of the drugs entering the U.S. by land and sea.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the Department of Justice, the cartel has trafficked "tons" of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl-laced heroin.</seg>
<seg id="12">El Mencho has a $10 million bounty on his head.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ironically, he lived in California some 30 years ago, where he was arrested on drug charges and eventually deported back to Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's where he started the violent cartel.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has got an enormous amount of weapons, RPGs, 50 caliber weapons.</seg>
<seg id="16">He basically has his own SWAT teams," Donahue said.</seg>
<seg id="17">From shooting down a Mexican Army helicopter, killing six, to being implicated in a public hanging this summer, El Mencho protects his empire with impunity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cartel violence has led to thousands of murders in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the meeting of ministers of the Non-Alignment Movement, the secretary of Sri Lankan external affairs noted that the applicability of Bandung principles as universal multilateral mechanisms is subject to trouble.</seg>
<seg id="3">The speech of the external affairs secretary is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="4">The secretary of Sri Lankan external affairs underlined that the applicability of Bandung principles as universal multilateral mechanisms is subject to trouble.</seg>
<seg id="5">As a side event of the 74th session of United Nations general assembly, while speaking in the minister's level meeting of the Non-Alignment Movement in New York on 26 September 2019, the secretary of external affairs underlined that the applicability of Bandung principles when the universal multilateral mechanisms is in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the Non-Alignment Movement includes 55 percent of the world population, it is its moral duty to voice the concerns of the South, particularly the growing small countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sri Lanka again confirmed its commitment towards the efforts of the Non-Aligned Movement that faces universal challenges such as conflicts, migration, climate change and infectious diseases that cross national borders.</seg>
<seg id="8">Non-traditional security threats such as climate change is not only a threat to the economy and community but also emerges as security threat that affects communities and countries due to man-made disasters.</seg>
<seg id="9">While welcoming the summit of United Nations General Secretary for climate-related actions, held in the headquarters of United Nations on 23 September 2019, the secretary Aryasinghe expressed his deep concerns about negative impacts of climate change in island nations such as Sri Lanka.</seg>
<seg id="10">The external affairs secretary expressed hope that by fulfilling the duties mentioned in the Paris agreement, the COP25 to be held in Chile will increase its efforts to combat climate change.</seg>
<seg id="11">The external affairs secretary Aryasinghe informed that Sri Lanka gains prominence in opposing all kinds of racism, hatred and violent extremism and there is the need to focus on the new threats that are proved by the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also noted that such a universal threat threatens the security of all nations and it cannot be handled by a single country but needs cooperation, and also he called upon the Non-Alignment Movement to contribute in a constructive and cohesive manner for this universal security threat.</seg>
<seg id="13">The external affairs secretary also noted that Sri Lanka believes in a free society where freedom of expression is ensured, however we should stay vigilant about hate speech and the threat of abusing the internet and social media platforms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The theme 'Upholding the principles of sovereignty and political freedom as a means of maintaining universal peace and security and improving friendship and cooperation between nations' became the subject of a ministers-level meeting and also an outcome document was accepted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sri Lanka was the joint sponsor of 1955 Bandung conference and a founder member of the Non-Alignment Movement.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Sri Lankan government has welcomed the proposal to allow Maldives back into the Commonwealth again.</seg>
<seg id="2">A media release given by the foreign affairs ministry regarding this is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="3">External affairs secretary Aryasinghe has welcomed the proposal to allow Maldives back into commonwealth again.</seg>
<seg id="4">Last Thursday the external affairs secretary Ravinatha Aryasinghe welcomed the proposal to allow Maldives back into the Commonwealth again and in order to allow complete participation in the Commonwealth government leaders' conference in 2020 he again insisted the complete support of Sri Lanka to use the fast-track process that was used in allowing Zambia back in again.</seg>
<seg id="5">He made this observation in the conference of the Commonwealth external affairs minister presided by the minister of state for the Commonwealth and United Nations Lord Ahmed of Wimbledon, as a side event of the 74th session of United Nations General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="6">He informed that Sri Lanka experiences a strong mutual relation with Maldives which is a close neighbour and one of the South Asian countries and we are happy that it has expressed its willingness to rejoin the Commonwealth as a part of one of the primary initiatives taken by the new administration during the last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The external affairs secretary has noted that extensive evaluation work done by the secretariat of the Commonwealth in January 2019 has paved the way for a positive resolution and any obstacle against its re-entry should be considered just as a simple defect that affects all countries.</seg>
<seg id="8">He insisted that further obstacles that lead to fewer incentives should not be kept in their path.</seg>
<seg id="9">The external affairs secretary also participated in the conference of the Group 77 (G77) external affairs ministers at New York on 27 September 2019.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was noted that G77 is being positioned uniquely to call for universal actions as a remedy for various needs of the countries in special situations such as underdeveloped countries, growing countries that are surrounded by land and growing small islands.</seg>
<seg id="11">This problem adversely affects economic and social development and also their ability to achieve sustainable development goals.</seg>
<seg id="12">This organisation should act as a collective voice that calls for international aid and support for vulnerable and marginalised countries, particularly towards financial and skill development.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also in a statement released during a cooperative discussion of a meeting regarding 'Science, Technology and Innovation' in which Sri Lanka acts as Associate Chief Operator, the external affairs secretary remarked that the Asian cooperation discussion region plays an important role in sustainable sociocultural and economic development.</seg>
<seg id="14">The mediation position played by the Asian cooperation discussion in promoting economic competitiveness helps Asian countries to compete equally in the world market.</seg>

<seg id="1">Quantum internet closer to reality -- ScienceDaily</seg>
<seg id="2">A U.S. Army research result brings the quantum internet a step closer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such an internet could offer the military security, sensing and timekeeping capabilities not possible with traditional networking approaches.</seg>
<seg id="4">The U.S. Army's Combat Capability Development's Army Research Laboratory's Center for Distributed Quantum Information, funded and managed by the lab's Army Research Office, saw researchers at the University of Innsbruck achieve a record for the transfer of quantum entanglement between matter and light -- a distance of 50 kilometers using fiber optic cables.</seg>
<seg id="5">Entanglement is a correlation that can be created between quantum entities such as qubits.</seg>
<seg id="6">When two qubits are entangled and a measurement is made on one, it will affect the outcome of a measurement made on the other, even if that second qubit is physically far away.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This [50 kilometers] is two orders of magnitude further than was previously possible and is a practical distance to start building inter-city quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physicist at University of Innsbruck and the principal investigator for the project, whose findings are published in the Nature journal Quantum Information.</seg>
<seg id="8">Intercity quantum networks would be composed of distant network nodes of physical qubits, which are, despite the large physical separation, nevertheless entangled.</seg>
<seg id="9">This distribution of entanglement is essential for establishing a quantum internet, researchers said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The demonstration is a major step forward for achieving large scale distributed entanglement," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-manager of the Army program supporting the research.</seg>
<seg id="11">The quality of the entanglement after traveling through fiber is also high enough at the other end to meet some of the requirements for some of the most difficult quantum networking applications.</seg>
<seg id="12">The research team started the experiment with a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.</seg>
<seg id="13">Using laser beams, the researchers wrote a quantum state onto the ion and simultaneously excited it to emit a photon in which quantum information is stored.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the light particle were entangled.</seg>
<seg id="15">The challenge is to transmit the photon over fiber optic cables.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The photon emitted by the calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the optical fiber," Lanyon said.</seg>
<seg id="17">His team therefore initially sent the light particle through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser.</seg>
<seg id="18">The photon wavelength was converted to the optimal value for long-distance travel -- the current telecommunications standard wavelength of 1,550 nanometers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The researchers then sent this photon through the 50-kilometer-long optical fiber line.</seg>
<seg id="20">Their measurements show that atom and light particles were still entangled even after the wavelength conversion and the distance traveled.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The choice to use calcium means these results also provide a direct path to realizing an entangled network of atomic clocks over a large physical distance, since calcium can be co-trapped with a high quality "clock" qubit.</seg>
<seg id="22">Large scale entangled clock networks are of great interest to the Army for precision position, navigation, and timing applications," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, an Army researcher who also co-manages the program.</seg>
