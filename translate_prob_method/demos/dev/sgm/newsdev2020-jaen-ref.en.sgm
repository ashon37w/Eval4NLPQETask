<seg id="4">The facility would hold waste from the Krsko nuclear plant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Holding banners reading "I want a healthy future" and "Stop - the Una (river) needs us," Bosnians they said a nuclear waste facility could endanger the Una River and the lives of around 250,000 area residents.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have to say NO!</seg>

<seg id="12">Croatian Minister of Environment Protection and Energy Tomislav Coric told the broadcaster that Croatia also has a problem disposing of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and was hoping to find an overall solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from all sides of the country's ethnic divide insisted that Croatia find another location in a part of the country nearer to the nuclear.</seg>
<seg id="14">"How come that out of entire Croatia, the best is the Trgovska Gora pocket that is in Bosnia's pants?" asked Drljaca.</seg>

<seg id="1">PayPay salesperson: "We're just riding the wave", the switch to cashless payments sees a rush of adopters, but will this wave turn into a swell? (Tokai Television) - Yahoo!News</seg>
<seg id="2">The sales tax will be going up in October.</seg>
<seg id="3">Accompanying this, the government will also begin the "Cashless Point Rebate Program".</seg>
<seg id="4">To counter the cooling of consumer spending, shoppers can get a rebate of up to 5%, but the condition is that they have to have paid with a cashless payment method.</seg>
<seg id="5">View in images: Shortly before the tax increase...Shops and businesses rush to adopt cashless payments</seg>
<seg id="6">As a result, there is a rush to adopt cashless payments.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stores that up until now only accepted cash are going cashless.</seg>
<seg id="8">We had a look at on location at a store introducing cashless payments.</seg>
<seg id="9">A rush before the tax increase... Shops and businesses are going cashless</seg>
<seg id="10">A confectionery store "Okakiya Tatsushin", in Chita, Aichi Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a popular store run by Takeshin Confectionery, with over 100 kinds of roasted mochi balls and strips lining its shelves.</seg>
<seg id="12">Today, Tatsushin is being visited by Ms. Yasuda from the smartphone payment service PayPay, which already boasts 12.5 million users.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms. Yasuda (PayPay): "Do you currently accept any payment methods other than cash?"</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms. Niimi (President of Takeshin Confectionery): "No, we're quite old-fashioned and only accept cash... "</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms. Yasuda: "Some of the benefits of PayPay include the fact that you don't need to hand over change, so you should appreciate a faster turnaround at the tills, plus when you get used to it I think you might find it easier than cash."</seg>
<seg id="16">PayPay has been running a ten billion yen campaign in which users receive 20% of the price they pay back as points.</seg>
<seg id="17">This approach has earnt them an explosive increase in the number of users, but Ms. Yasuda is a salesperson to the places where those users will use the payment method, in other words, she is selling the PayPay system to shops.</seg>
<seg id="18">Okakiya Tatsushin had been a cash-only business up until now.</seg>
<seg id="19">On listening to Yasuda's sales pitch, President Niimi also decided to join PayPay.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ms. Yasuda: "I'm really busy, and I think it's probably at its peak right now. Places that I've called into before that wouldn't let me talk to them now think that if we help them with the consumer rebate program, then they'd like to hear about PayPay, and I usually get them to sign up as a participating store, so I pretty much feel like I'm riding the wave right now."</seg>
<seg id="21">- Riding the "cashless wave" with the government's consumer rebate program!</seg>
<seg id="22">The reason Ms. Yasuda gave for feeling like she was riding on a wave is the government's consumer rebate program.</seg>
<seg id="23">The government will raise sales taxes in October, and to counter the anticipated cooling of consumer spending, they are implementing a program in which customers will get a rebate of up to 5% of the purchase amount, on the condition that they paid with a cashless payment method.</seg>
<seg id="24">Therefore, many small to medium-sized retailers are considering adopting cashless payments before the taxes are raised, just like Okakiya Tatsushin.</seg>

<seg id="1">What is Munchhausen's by proxy mentioned in The Politician on Netflix?</seg>
<seg id="2">The condition means carers or parents pretend their child is ill when they are healthy.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Politican hits Netflix today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The show tells the story of Payton Hobart who wants to be President of the United States of America - but first, he has to be student body president at his high school.</seg>
<seg id="5">Made by American Horror Story and Glee creator Ryan Murphy, it features Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.</seg>
<seg id="6">Without revealing too much for those who haven't had a chance to watch it yet, the show includes a storyline about Munchhausen's by proxy - a mental illness where a carer acts as if the person they are looking after has a physical or mental illness when they are not really sick.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are different types of the condition, including Munchhausen's where a person pretends that they themselves are ill.</seg>
<seg id="8">Munchhausen's By Proxy, however, is specifically about making up that someone that you care for is ill.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is also known as fabricated or induced illness (FII) and is categorised as child abuse.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a rare condition and usually involves a parent exaggerating symptoms or causing symptoms to make it seem like their child is ill.</seg>
<seg id="11">What are the signs of Munchhausen's by proxy?</seg>
<seg id="12">The signs of the condition can vary from case to case but the NHS says that things to be aware of include:</seg>
<seg id="13">Persuading medical professionals that their child is unwell but they seem healthy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Exaggerating or lying about symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="15">Manipulating results to suggest the child is ill, for example putting glucose in urine samples to make it look like they have diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Inducing symptoms of illness, for example giving them unnecessary medication or other substances.</seg>
<seg id="17">How common is Munchhausen's by proxy?</seg>
<seg id="18">As many cases aren't reported, it's difficult to know how widespread the condition is.</seg>
<seg id="19">One study published in 2000 estimated 89 cases in a population of 100,000 over a two year period.</seg>
<seg id="20">What should you do if you think a child is at risk</seg>
<seg id="21">You can contact your local social services department or telephone the NSPCC's child protection helpline on 0808 800 5000.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police Command yesterday raided a school, Imamu Ahmad Bn Hambal, located at Layin Maidubun Tsumma at Rigasa in Igabi Local Government Area of the state, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police alleged that the children were kept in a very dehumanising condition; an allegation the school authority denied.</seg>
<seg id="4">A resident who identified himself as Shehu, a preacher in the school, said: "What they're saying is not true because all the children are there with the consent of their parents.</seg>
<seg id="5">The parents signed a form before the children were enrolled in the school.</seg>
<seg id="6">The parents used to bring food to their children daily and they also know the condition they are in.</seg>
<seg id="7">We were very surprised when the police came and evacuated the children as well as removed all the students' food brought by their parents before they shut down the school.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is unfair because we have parents to testify if their children are kept in bad conduction as claimed by the police.</seg>
<seg id="9">He added that the immediate past Police Commissioner Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to see how the children were taken care, never complained.</seg>
<seg id="10">‎He said the children only studied Quran and nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the Police Command Public Relations Officer, Yakubu Sabo, said the children would be reunited with their parents after handing them over to the state government.</seg>
<seg id="12">"They were kept in dehumanising condition in the name of undergoing or acquiring Quranic knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="13">With many of them with scars on their back which show they were beaten.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, we're investigating the school to know the owner of the facility," he said.</seg>

<seg id="7">When she pleaded "stop, stop, stop," he put her in a headlock and forced her into the scrub.</seg>

<seg id="2">Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good.</seg>
<seg id="3">Francis addressed a Vatican conference that brought government envoys and Facebook and Google representatives together with philosophers, physicists and ethicists.</seg>
<seg id="4">A smattering of academics and Catholic bishops rounded out participants at "The Common Good in the Digital Age" conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The three-day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and perils of artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debates included technology advancements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines, as well as a case study examining the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the carnage.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his speech to the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monotonous labor.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he warned that increased reliance on robotics for the sake of profits risked depriving people of the dignity of labor.</seg>
<seg id="9">"If technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities, it would not be true and real progress," he warned.</seg>
<seg id="10">If mankind's so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.</seg>

<seg id="3">Social activist Anna Hazare has expressed surprise over Nationalist Congress Party or NCP chief Sharad Pawar's name cropping up in the multi-crore Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank scam.</seg>
<seg id="4">Probe agency Enforcement Directorate or ED has filed a money laundering case against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar - a former deputy chief minister of Maharashtra - and others in connection with the scam.</seg>
<seg id="5">An Enforcement Case Information Report, equivalent to a police FIR, has been registered by the central agency under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.</seg>
<seg id="6">The case is based on a Mumbai Police FIR which had named former chairmen of the bank, Ajit Pawar, and 70 erstwhile functionaries of the cooperative lender.</seg>
<seg id="7">When this case came to me, Sharad Pawar's name was not there anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="8">How did his name crop up, who mentioned his name, all these things only they know," Anna Hazare said on Thursday when asked about the ED case and Sharad Pawar's alleged links to the scam.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anna Hazare, a Sharad Pawar critic, expressed the hope that the truth will come out after the ED carries out a detailed investigation in the scam.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The ED will come to know how his name figured in the case," said Anna Hazare, a veteran of many anti-corruption agitations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sharad Pawar has denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was not associated with the bank in any capacity and questioned the timing of the registration of the case which comes just weeks ahead of the October 21 Assembly polls in Maharashtra.</seg>
<seg id="12">The former Union minister has asserted he would not bow before the "throne" of Delhi, apparently referring to the BJP-led government at the Centre.</seg>
<seg id="13">The NCP has termed the Enforcement Directorate case as politically motivated.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man who was arrested in connection with the murder of University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) student Sinethemba Ndlovu is expected to apply for bail next week, according to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).</seg>
<seg id="3">The accused appeared in the Msinga Magistrate's Court on Thursday on a charge of murder.</seg>
<seg id="4">KZN NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara told News24 that the case was postponed to October 2 for the bail application.</seg>
<seg id="5">She added that the State would oppose the accused's release on bail.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to KZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele, the 20-year-old accused was arrested on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ndlovu was stabbed below her left armpit and stomach, police said earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's believed that she worked as a hostess at the Msinga Driftkhana motorsport event on Saturday evening.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a statement issued that day, organisers of the motorsport event said preliminary reports suggested that a few hostesses remained behind after the event to watch some of the musical performances after their shift ended.</seg>
<seg id="10">On their way, sadly, one of them was attacked by unknown men and later passed [a]way in hospital," their statement read.</seg>
<seg id="11">UKZN suspended academic activities on Friday, saying "the circumstances of Ndlovu's death requires us as a community to pause and reflect on the fragility of life, and the brutality that often exists in our society."</seg>

<seg id="2">4 sudden start prevention devices that can be retrofitted (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News</seg>
<seg id="3">You can buy peace of mind for surprisingly reasonable prices</seg>
<seg id="4">Traffic accidents caused by driver error.</seg>
<seg id="5">Above all else, accidents caused by elderly drivers accidently pressing the accelerator instead of the breaks have begun to increase.</seg>
<seg id="6">They especially panic when the car suddenly starts moving, and keep stepping on the accelerator while thinking they are stepping on the brake pedal.</seg>
<seg id="7">New vehicles with safe driving functions that can correct such driver errors have been appearing, and there are also devices that can be retrofit onto vehicles that don't have these functions equipped.</seg>
<seg id="8">The sudden start prevention system these after production parts makers sell.</seg>
<seg id="9">We'd like to introduce a few to show what kind of features they have.</seg>
<seg id="10">Stepping on both accelerator and break because distance between them is narrow</seg>
<seg id="11">[e-ACCEL ALARM] The e-ACCEL ALARM, developed by Pivot, notifies you of pedal stepping mistakes in a new way.</seg>
<seg id="12">It sounds an alarm if the wrong pedal is stepped on.</seg>
<seg id="13">The mechanism is such that, an alarm is sound when the accelerator is pressed more than necessary, when mistaking it for the break while driving slowly or stopping.</seg>
<seg id="14">The sound notifies the driver to ease back on the accelerator and avoid speeding up by quickly recognizing the wrong step.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is also effective for elderly drivers who are unable to hear the change in engine sounds when they step on the accelerator by accident.</seg>
<seg id="16">Insert it into the OBDII connector and the body sticks with double-sided tape.</seg>
<seg id="17">The price is reasonable at 9800 yen (excluding tax) and the no installation simplicity is appealing.</seg>
<seg id="18">[Ashimoto Mimamoru-kun] World Wing launched an accelerator/break mistake prevention device called "Ashimoto Mimamoru-kun" in mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="19">It support not just forward movement, but also backwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the accelerator is suddenly pressed when moving forward or backward while stopping (or driving at less than 10Km/h) it detects the vehicle’s speed signal and brake signal and suppresses the sudden start by electronically controlling the accelerator.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you accidentally step on the accelerator it won't transmit the signal from the accelerator and instead instantly turn to creep drive (Brake released in the D range) which controls the sudden start.</seg>
<seg id="22">It also detects the speed of the vehicle going backwards above 5 km/h and has the function to force switch the vehicle to creep mode.</seg>
<seg id="23">Installation is possible with just a coupler and some simple wiring.</seg>
<seg id="24">The main unit is 37000 yen (excluding tax).</seg>

<seg id="2">A review of the city's third sector that was carried out by the Fukui town planning council has revealed that the current number of vacant stores in Fukui's Chuo 1-chome is 39 as of the end of August, down seven in the six months since March.</seg>
<seg id="3">A number of stores specialising in tapioca drinks opening in quick succession has led to the reduction of vacant stores.</seg>
<seg id="4">The situation has improved to a level just behind that of February 2016, when the "Beauty Town Project" that invited people to set up shops on the theme of beauty, and other renovation works, were especially active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The review only considered stores at street level.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fifteen new stores have appeared in the six months since the last review, with 12 of them opening in previously vacant stores.</seg>
<seg id="7">Meanwhile, five stores have become vacant due to closures.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are 320 stores in total, and the vacancy rate is 12.2%, down 1.9 points from the previous review.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of the 15 new stores, five specialise in serving tapioca drinks.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since June, they have sprung up in locations such as Kitanosho-dori Street and Fukui Ekimae Minami-dori Street.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the Fukui town planning council, more tapioca drink stores have appeared in once vacant stores on Fukui Ekimae Densha-dori Street since the review was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="12">A source attached to the review said, "While the initial fervor that saw long queues even on weekdays has calmed down, you still see plenty of women walking down the street, tapioca in hand."</seg>
<seg id="13">A look at areas where redevelopment is planned reveals four new stores (two of them tapioca drink stores) and one store closure.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the council's investigations, the number of vacant stores in Chuo 1-chome was at the highest in August 2010, with 78 vacant stores (a vacancy rate of 20.3%).</seg>
<seg id="15">After that, the situation improved and the number of vacant stores was stable around 40 from February 2016 onwards, but rose to 46 in February of this year.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the 27th, "Shiroishi Town Childcare Support Club Hug Hug" (representative: Tanaka Tomoko) held a round-table discussion in the Ariake Community Centre in Sakada, Shiroishi, to share experiences and the lessons learnt from the recent heavy rain in Saga.</seg>
<seg id="3">Around 20 mothers with young children thought about the form of disaster prevention that would be most suited to their family, and collated their observations and requests for the local government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kusumoto Saori (32) of Kitagata-machi, Takeo, said that her 3-year-old who had previously liked nursery school suddenly no longer wanted to go after the floods, and had begun to have nightmares.</seg>
<seg id="5">Looking back on it, she remarked, "I think it could have been because the adults were so busy with cleaning up their homes, that we couldn't spend the proper amount of time with our children," adding, "I'd like to be prepared for a disaster so that I can tell my children that everything is okay, and don't panic as an adult."</seg>
<seg id="6">Ogushi Yukari (36) of Shiroishi told of how she spent the night at the town hall which was being used as an evacuation shelter with all four member of her family, including her 3-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="7">She said of the experience, "When you have a child who can't stay still, you worry about the people around you."</seg>
<seg id="8">The area around the house of a woman (45) in central Saga, who has five children aged four to 12, was completely submerged.</seg>
<seg id="9">Reasoning that, "I can't carry all five to safety," she has prepared food and a portable toilet with the intention of staying home in an emergency if possible.</seg>
<seg id="10">"There's no correct way to prepare. The kind of preparations that are necessary vary depending on one's family structure and living conditions," she appealed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kawasaki Shinako (40) from Shiroishi, who has a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old, said, "There was an email from the primary school the day before to say that it would be closed, but the nursery school has neither a network nor an email system. It would be good if they had a system to send out mass emails."</seg>
<seg id="12">There was also demand for the creation of a system that would share what roads are flooded in real time.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms. Kawasaki said, "The weather is now different from how it used to be, so one cannot simply say 'It was fine last time.' I'd like disaster preparations to take into account things like people connections and other schemes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Boris Johnson referred to police watchdog over friendship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri</seg>
<seg id="2">The Independent Office for Police Conduct will now assess whether the Prime Minister should be investigated for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was mayor of London.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Greater London Authority (GLA) said in a statement that the authority's monitoring officer had recorded a "conduct matter" against the Prime Minister over allegations Ms Arcuri received favourable treatment because of her friendship with him.</seg>
<seg id="4">"A "conduct matter" exists where there is information that indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed," it said.</seg>
<seg id="5">It does not mean that this is proved in any way.</seg>
<seg id="6">The IOPC will now consider if it is necessary for the matter to be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The issue has been referred to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against police forces in England and Wales.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was referred to the watchdog because Mr Johnson at the time held the post equivalent to a police and crime commissioner.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Ms Arcuri.</seg>
<seg id="10">Earlier he said that he would comply with an order by the London Assembly to provide details of his links with Ms Arcuri, although he insisted they were "barking up the wrong tree."</seg>
<seg id="11">It follows a report by The Sunday Times that Ms Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, was given £126,000 in public money and was treated to privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Government has since frozen a £100,000 grant to Ms Arcuri's company, Hacker House, pending a review.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is facing embarrassing questions about the verification process carried out before awarding the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Digital Minister Matt Warman told the Commons that his department had done the "usual due diligence" and that the company had a British phone number.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, numerous reports said calls to the number were directed to an office in California, where Ms Arcuri, 34, is said to now be based.</seg>
<seg id="16">PM's friendship with businesswoman 'was open secret among staff'</seg>
<seg id="17">The move by the GLA to refer the Prime Minister to the Independent Office for Police Conduct has met with anger from No 10.</seg>
<seg id="18">A senior Government source said it was "a politically motivated attack" and that the timing - on the eve of the Conservative Party conference - was "overtly political."</seg>
<seg id="19">"No evidence of any allegations has been provided by the monitoring officer nor was the PM given any opportunity to respond to the monitoring officer prior to the publishing of a press release late on a Friday night," the source said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job.</seg>
<seg id="21">Earlier today, the Standard was told Mr Johnson's close friendship with the Californian entrepreneur helped by London's tourism and promotions agency was an "open secret" among its staff.</seg>
<seg id="22">Former officials at the agency, London & Partners (L&P), recalled how Ms Arcuri was given places on foreign trade trips led by Mr Johnson in his time as mayor despite her companies being regarded as "not credible" by some at the time.</seg>

<seg id="3">We asked the Chief Executive Officer of Sawakami Fund, Mr. Sawakami Ryo (Picture) about his vision for the future.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sawakami Fund" has celebrated its 20th anniversary since it's founding this August.</seg>
<seg id="5">Looking back the past 20 years, how do you feel at this moment?</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the 20 years of history was built on many people's emotions and hard work.</seg>
<seg id="7">I would like to show my deepest gratitude for all those who have taken part, since this history was not achieved only with “Sawakami Fund”.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sawakami Fund was initially founded with the desire to “support wealth accumulation of average citizens”</seg>
<seg id="9">This motto has not changed, and we have pursued this goal honestly for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our company as a whole strives to do our best daily, with the belief that if people are free from financial stress, the world will inherently get brighter.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the long run, great results will not be achieved unless management is in lockstep with beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="12">A great amount of money comes into "Sawakami Fund" during times of market free-fall, such as Lehman Shock and IT bubble burst.</seg>
<seg id="13">I feel that our message, that we always say, which is "in times like these, we want to support companies that are truly needed", is understood well.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result is the reason our fund became a long lasting fund with 20 years behind it, and because we have a direct sales approach that allows us to relay our message to our customers, this was possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">We have been disclosing the list of all the investing companies, amounts, and cost in our monthly report.</seg>
<seg id="16">Usually, information of what is being bought is a black box and only results are relayed, but "Sawakami Fund" discloses everything.</seg>
<seg id="17">This transparency must be another reason people trust us.</seg>

<seg id="2">LOS ANGELES (AP) - A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offenses in connection with rapper Mac Miller's overdose death last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Court documents show Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl that Miller possessed before he died last September of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a powerful opioid contributing to an epidemic that's claimed thousands of lives in the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="4">Walter is accused of being the source of the pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.</seg>
<seg id="5">Court documents unsealed Tuesday say Pettit kept getting drugs from Walter through August.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is accused of serving as Walter's "runner" who delivered the pills to Pettit.</seg>
<seg id="7">None of the men have been directly charged with Miller's death or have entered pleas in their cases.</seg>
<seg id="8">Walter, who is on supervised release in a 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been ordered to serve five months in prison for violating the terms of his release.</seg>
<seg id="9">Prosecutors handling the case, which was first reported Thursday by celebrity website TMZ, are asking that Walter remain in custody while he awaits trial, calling him a serious flight risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">A phone message left with his lawyer wasn't immediately returned.</seg>
<seg id="11">Pettit was charged in federal court on Sept. 4, and his attorney has declined to comment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Miller's rhymes included frank discussion of his depression and drug use, earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hip-hop.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Pittsburgh native whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick was also in a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="14">After his death, she posted an affectionate video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, "Thank U Next," that lovingly mentioned him.</seg>
<seg id="15">Miller is among the musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to opioid abuse.</seg>
<seg id="16">Matthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016 and had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system.</seg>
<seg id="17">This story has been corrected to show that Walter's first name is spelled Stephen, not Steven.</seg>

<seg id="2">The 9-year-old is building a hide and seek game, using a free programming application called Scratch 2.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations, and stories online or offline.</seg>
<seg id="4">So far, Basil has used it to generate more than 30 mobile games.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today's game involves a bat he has programmed to hide.</seg>
<seg id="6">The player gets a point every time he catches the bat when it emerges from its hiding place.</seg>
<seg id="7">I learned how to build games at a boot camp.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Now, I build to keep me busy when I am bored," Basil told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="9">In March, his father signed him up for a five-day boot camp for children aged 5 to 15.</seg>
<seg id="10">The camp, organized by Codefest International, was put in place to give children like Basil access to emerging technologies like robotics and virtual reality.</seg>
<seg id="11">Growing up, Basil used to play a lot of mobile games says his father, Basil Okpara Sr.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I bought him a tablet when he was 4 years old because I saw that he was always grabbing phones to play games with.</seg>
<seg id="13">He played Candy Crush and Temple Run a lot," the father told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Basil's interest in creating his games grew at age 7 after he got scolded for spending all of his time playing.</seg>
<seg id="15">"There was this day he was on the tablet, as usual, he was so carried away with the game he was playing that I got upset with him," his father said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Out of annoyance, I said to him, 'you are always playing games, can't you think about building your own games so others can play yours too?'.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was angry when I said it, and I did not know he took it seriously," he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Former North Carolina GOP Chair To Plead Guilty For Lying In Bribery Probe</seg>
<seg id="2">A former North Carolina GOP chairman will admit in court that he lied to federal agents conducting a bribery investigation of a major political donor, according to court documents filed Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The federal court docket shows that Robin Hayes is scheduled to enter a guilty plea next Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">A factual basis document prepared as part of the plea agreement and signed by Hayes' attorney said that Hayes knew he was making false statements to FBI agents conducting the bribery probe in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="5">The actual plea agreement is sealed, and the factual basis doesn't specify which charges he'll plead guilty to.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery and making false statements.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prosecutors have accused Hayes, a former congressman, of involvement in an insurance executive's plan to funnel campaign contributions to the state's top insurance regulator in exchange for special treatment.</seg>
<seg id="8">The executive, Greg Lindberg, and two of his associates have been charged with attempting to bribe state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lindberg is an insurance and investment firm founder who has been among the state's top political donors in recent years, giving more than $5 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016.</seg>
<seg id="10">He favored Republican causes and politicians, but also gave to Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="11">His attorney did not respond to an email seeking comment Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">A defense attorney for Hayes, Kearns Davis, didn't respond to an email Friday seeking further comment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The court documents filed Friday state that Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he had never had conversations with Causey about staff at the state Department of Insurance.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Hayes had in fact spoken to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request to make personnel changes within the regulator's agency, according to the factual basis document.</seg>
<seg id="15">Prosecutors have said that Hayes also helped Lindberg request a meeting with Causey and that Hayes discussed the bribe directly with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="16">An indictment unsealed in April alleges that Lindberg wanted special treatment for his insurance businesses and planned to funnel up to $2 million for Causey's 2020 reelection campaign.</seg>
<seg id="17">The scheme involved a request to replace a department official who had been examining a Lindberg company, according to the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="18">Causey, a Republican, reported the alleged attempted bribe to federal investigators and helped them build their case.</seg>
<seg id="19">He faces no charges.</seg>
<seg id="20">The indictment states that an associate of Lindberg's directed Hayes to transfer $250,000 to Causey's reelection campaign during a conversation that also included Lindberg and Causey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hayes initially protested, saying that moving so much money would draw attention, but eventually relented during the conversation, according to the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Whatever you all want to do, we'll do," Hayes said, according to the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Alright, I'll get "er done."</seg>
<seg id="24">A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor's office didn't respond to an email seeking further information about the plea agreement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Facebook to hide number of likes in trial aimed at improving users' wellbeing</seg>
<seg id="2">Some Facebook users will soon no longer see the number of likes, reactions and video views on other's posts in a world-first trial aimed at boosting users' wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Instead, likes will be private and only visible to the post's author in a change that follows a similar test on Instagram which started in July in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new Facebook trial, which begins on Friday, will also kick off in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Facebook Australia's director of policy Mia Garlick said the change was based on wellbeing research and feedback from mental health professionals that the number of likes can cause social comparison.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We've had really positive feedback from a lot of the anti-bullying groups and mental health organisations that we work with," Garlick said.</seg>
<seg id="7">It really is just taking that number out of the equation, so that people can focus on the quality of their interactions and the quality of the content rather than on the number of likes or reactions.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's hoped that people will be more comfortable with sharing on the platform rather than feeling like it's a competition, she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Garlick assured businesses who rely on Facebook they will still receive all the same metrics and insights they previously accessed.</seg>
<seg id="10">She said it was too early to say if the test would roll out to other countries like Instagram's trial has in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="11">As with Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, there is no indication of when the trial will end or if the change will be made permanent.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have had some initial positive feedback from the public about the experience [on Instagram], but we're still just learning and listening to feedback at this stage," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">On being the world's training ground Garlick said Australia has very active "tech-savvy" users of Facebook and Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="14">We think this is a great country where we can get some really good feedback about whether this is a valuable experience for people on our services or not.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day, the metal fitting on my mother's favorite bag came off and was lost.</seg>
<seg id="3">If a favorite bag breaks, it's natural to want to repair it and keep using it.</seg>
<seg id="4">What helped me at that time was a handicraft component from Cando.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just when I was about to give up thinking "they may not have it anymore..."</seg>
<seg id="6">My mother's broken bag is actually an ultimate bargain item.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, if you asked a store to repair it, the cost would exceed the worth of the bag.</seg>
<seg id="8">My mother sadly said "maybe it's time to give it up..." but I didn't want to give up.</seg>
<seg id="9">First I checked home centers to look for an alternative connective piece.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, even though there were metal rings, they were all silver colored.</seg>
<seg id="11">I couldn't find gold anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="12">I checked CanDo as a last resort, and that's when I found it!</seg>
<seg id="13">I was impressed when I found it in the handicrafts corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">As to be expected of a 100 yen shop, you can find anything.</seg>
<seg id="15">It seems like it was originally meant to be a component for DIY key chains and charms.</seg>
<seg id="16">We planned to use one on either hand of the bag handle, so we bought 2.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although the ring is smaller, when you look at it next to the remaining connector, it's exactly the same...!</seg>
<seg id="18">This opens the way for repairing the bag.</seg>
<seg id="19">I installed it immediately.</seg>
<seg id="20">So excited...!</seg>
<seg id="21">The ring is designed to push inward at its opening so it's resistant to being pulled outward.</seg>
<seg id="22">I immediately attached it to the bag.</seg>
<seg id="23">The gold color of the fittings matches well! but, because the ring is small, it's tight and doesn't move well...</seg>
<seg id="24">So, I decided to connect 2 rings.</seg>
<seg id="25">The number of parts has increased, but since they are light there's no problem with the weight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rather, the sparkling parts have increased, and I feel like the design has leveled up.</seg>

<seg id="2">Qandeel Baloch, who shot to fame for her social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.</seg>
<seg id="3">The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was on Friday convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison in the patriarchal country's highest-profile "honour killing."</seg>
<seg id="4">Baloch, who shot to fame for her risque selfies -- tame by Western standards, but considered provocative in deeply misogynistic Pakistan -- was strangled in July 2016.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="6">Days later he told a press conference that he had no remorse over what he did, saying that "of course" he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour had been "intolerable."</seg>
<seg id="7">His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP the court in the eastern city of Multan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, in a long-awaited verdict.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Inshallah (God willing), he will be acquitted by a high court," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai told AFP she had hoped her son would be acquitted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="11">She was my daughter and he is my son," she said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Baloch's murder made international headlines and reignited calls for action against an epidemic of so-called "honour killings," in which a victim -- usually a woman -- is murdered for flouting patriarchal social codes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Women have been burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for offences such as choosing their own husband or -- in Baloch's case -- bringing "shame" on their family by celebrating their sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="14">The killings are usually carried out by a close relative.</seg>
<seg id="15">Under Pakistan's Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retribution) law, they can then seek forgiveness from a victim's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="16">Three months after Baloch's murder, parliament passed new legislation mandating life imprisonment for honour killings.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, whether a murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion, meaning that killers can theoretically claim a different motive and still be pardoned.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Baloch's case, her parents initially insisted their son would be given no absolution.</seg>
<seg id="19">But, heartbroken at the thought of losing him also, they changed their minds and said they wanted him to be forgiven.</seg>
<seg id="20">International revulsion at the killing had seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside the parents, however, forcing the case to move ahead.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of Baloch's better-known actions included offering to perform a striptease for the Pakistani cricket team, and donning a plunging scarlet dress on Valentine's Day.</seg>
<seg id="22">She attracted criticism and threats but was perceived by many, including young people, as breaking new ground in a country where presenting yourself as a Kim Kardashian-like figure can be seen as a bold, political act of women's empowerment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The roots of "honour" killings lie in tribal social norms, which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular, though men can be victims too.</seg>

<seg id="3">As well as proactively linking the projects run by both organisations, such as coaching for various sports, they will also establish a mutual support system to prevent against injuries and manage the physical condition of children from the outlying islands when they go on trips away from the islands.</seg>
<seg id="4">When the two organisations run sports-related courses, they will work as agents to dispatch their associated trainers and instructors, and share information with each other.</seg>
<seg id="5">They will also work on solutions for the problems encountered when a team from one of the outlying islands travels to a tournament away from the islands, such as the issue of bringing the trainer along being cost prohibitive due to travel expenses.</seg>
<seg id="6">For instance, in the event of a tournament on the mainland, such as a prefectural tournament, ASA will coordinate with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Centre to offer players support to prevent their performance deteriorating from the fatigue caused by travelling by ferry and staying consecutive nights in accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Similarly, when tournaments occur on Amami-Oshima and Okinoerabu-shima, the organisations will coordinate with local osteopaths and hospitals to provide support to players visiting from the mainland.</seg>
<seg id="8">A signing ceremony was held at Erabucoco, China-cho, on the 25th, with Sonoda and Maeda shaking hands.</seg>
<seg id="9">Afterwards, the two organisations co-hosted a class on taping given by the athletic trainer, Hidaka Yuichiro.</seg>
<seg id="10">Local junior sports club members, club leaders and parents learned how to tape effectively, as well as how to prevent injuries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chairman Sonoda (52) commented, "We have a common goal of working to eliminate the handicap of the outlying islands as an environment for sports, and there are many areas where we can cooperate. I hope that entering into this partnership will allow us to expand our sphere of cooperation to the other islands of Amami."</seg>
<seg id="12">Chairman Maeda (43) said of the partnership, "It was very encouraging for us to be able to form a partnership with an organisation that has such a strong track record like ASA.

<seg id="8">"Must" mindset makes it hard to thrive</seg>
<seg id="9">In the first half, he emphasized the need to learn patterns on a daily basis by observing a variety of arts and people since "attractiveness" is constantly evolving.</seg>

<seg id="6">"It paints a horrible picture of lawlessness and insecurity," he told journalists on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said there were frequent reports of kidnapping, torture, extortion, murder and sexual violence by attackers who also destroy homes and steal property.</seg>
<seg id="8">Military and police have been deployed to tackle criminal gangs in the region.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the military is stretched from fights against Boko Haram and Islamic State's West Africa branch, which split from the former group in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The refugees are not coming with names of groups," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">What they are coming with are horrific accounts.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those fleeing are mostly crossing into neighboring Niger.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a statement, the UNHCR said it expected more to flee to Niger in the coming months as the security situation, particularly in Sokoto state, deteriorates.</seg>

<seg id="1">Distribution of adverts implementing header bidding via Prebid.js in Logicad for Publishers (hereafter, LFP) offered by So-net Media Networks (SMN), has begun.</seg>
<seg id="2">LFP is a service that allows advertisers to individually plan and purchase advertising space according to their needs.</seg>
<seg id="3">In cooperation with publishers, this service provides effective advertising space through the DSP Logicad.</seg>
<seg id="4">Header bidding is a technique that allows multiple bidders (advertising companies) to bid fairly, so that the highest-bidding adverts will be displayed preferentially on the publisher's media platform.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is increasingly being adopted by major media companies as a solution that offers a high level of transparency and increased revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">Up until now, Logicad had offered advertising space via SSP.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in recent years, in response to advertisers' wish to be able to "distribute ads to specific advertising spaces that are in line with their brand image or individual products", we launched LFP last December in cooperation with publishers, allowing the direct purchase of advertising space that suits the advertisers' needs.</seg>
<seg id="8">With adding support for header bidding, the number of places where LFP is used will increase.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the many benefits for advertisers is that the support of header bidding in LFP will make it possible to directly participate in bidding for advertising space eligible for header bidding, thereby increasing the opportunities for ad distribution.</seg>
<seg id="10">What's more, since the target publishers are limited, the advertising space that bests fits with the brand image or individual products can be secured, thereby preventing the risk of damaging the value of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="11">Benefits for the publisher include the "wrapper solution", a management solution that assigns each bidding company a code, making it possible for publishers to introduce them as they see fit.</seg>

<seg id="2">With just three weeks to go until a showdown EU leaders' summit, fears are growing around the PM's top table that he is running out of time to win major concessions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Boris Johnson is facing a Cabinet revolt to lower his Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">Negotiators are deadlocked over a new customs system to replace the Irish backstop, with Brussels branding Mr Johnson's alternative arrangements proposals as "unworkable."</seg>
<seg id="5">Senior ministers expect EU power brokers - led by Germany's Angela Merkel - to offer the embattled Tory leader a last minute compromise, such as a three year time limit on the backstop.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Sun has spoken to three different Cabinet ministers, who are all preparing to confront him after the Tories" annual conference in Manchester next week.</seg>
<seg id="7">They will demand he abandons the "aggressive" strategy devised by senior aide Dominic Cummings to try to bluff the EU with the threat of No Deal, and insist he accepts the EU's last minute offer.</seg>
<seg id="8">One Cabinet minister dubbed the crushing Supreme Court verdict to end Parliament's suspension on Tuesday as "a wake-up call," adding: "A deal is the only way we can leave on October 31 now.</seg>
<seg id="9">We're never going to beat the numbers in the Commons, and they are against us.</seg>
<seg id="10">The PM has to lean in now and take what he can get.</seg>
<seg id="11">Being aggressive doesn't work, the Cummings plan has clearly failed.</seg>
<seg id="12">We just can't fight battles on so many fronts.</seg>
<seg id="13">A second Cabinet minister has vowed to tell Mr Johnson to try to push through ex-PM Theresa May's deal if all else fails.</seg>
<seg id="14">That senior minister added: "I will tell Boris to put Theresa's deal back to the Commons if I have to."</seg>
<seg id="15">The numbers are there for it now, everyone is desperate to end this.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's all over for Boris and it's all over for all of us if we're forced to extend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir John Major accused Boris of not taking the negotiation seriously.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a withering speech, the former Tory premier said: "The Prime Minister tells us he wishes to have a deal with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="19">But we don't see him sitting down in Brussels, hammering out an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Instead, we do see him wrestling with bulls in Scotland; inspecting eggs in Wales; and arguing with the public in high streets - for all the world as if an election campaign was already in full swing."</seg>
<seg id="21">The PM's spokesman yesterday admitted a deal was still far off, saying: "No one should be under any illusion - there is a very long way to go if we are to secure a deal."</seg>
<seg id="22">But the spokesman also said the Benn Act to enforce a three months delay if there is no deal was "actively undermining our negotiating position" in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="23">He said: "There is no doubt that it has hindered our negotiating position but the Prime Minister and colleagues through hard work have continued to try and make progress in the face of that piece of legislation."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lorraine Kelly revealed that TV bosses told her she would "never make it" as a presenter because of her Glaswegian accent.</seg>
<seg id="3">Looking back on 35 years in broadcasting, Kelly, 59, recalled how she felt "very nervous" ahead of her first appearance on screen.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I was only 25 and very nervous," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga turned down an offer by the late president Robert Mugabe to take over the presidency at the height of the coup as he feared it might be a trap to rubberstamp the military take-over in November 2017, a senior government official has claimed.</seg>
<seg id="3">As reported by the Zimbabwe Independent last week, Mugabe offered Chiwenga to take over the presidency as negotiations between him and the army ensued during the coup.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, a senior government official said on social media Chiwenga did not turn down the offer out of fear, but he was able to see through Mugabe's plan to use him to prove to world leaders and the African Union (AU) that indeed he had been toppled in a coup.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a Twitter thread which confirmed Zimbabwe's 37-year-ruler was willing to hand over power to Chiwenga and not President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, whom government officials confirmed was a senior government official in the Office of the President and Cabinet, said intense negotiations were held at the time over the issue.</seg>
<seg id="6">Government officials said Mugabe approached Chiwenga through one of his emissaries when he realised power was slipping though his hands.</seg>
<seg id="7">Intercession between the military command element and late former president had three strands, according to the senior government official.</seg>
<seg id="8">The official said characters involved in the negotiations included presidential spokesperson George Charamba, Central Intelligence Organisation then acting boss Aaron Nhepera and Roman Catholic Bishop cleric Fidelis Mukonori.</seg>
<seg id="9">Former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor Gideon Gono was another strand after he was sent by Mugabe on a one-man mission with the offer of the presidency to Chiwenga who was the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) commander.</seg>
<seg id="10">The man, who in death more than in life has been described as an African icon, tried in vain to get the AU to denounce the military operation, while seeking intervention by other African leaders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Offer of presidency to then CDF (Commander Defence Forces Chiwenga) by the late (Mugabe) was not by choice.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It was a desperate act to save the situation which had grown dangerously fast-paced; wearing down a part of the late's family," the official (Jamwanda) wrote.</seg>
<seg id="13">But there was also a bit of political baiting which the late hoped would turn the tables, at the very least diplomatically.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recall that commanders had declared they had not, and would not, overthrow the constitutional order, a development which would have set them on a collision with the AU position on coups.</seg>
<seg id="15">The late (Mugabe) hoped the then CDF (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, thereby putting paid to claims by commanders they had not overthrown the constitutional order.</seg>
<seg id="16">The hope for (the) late (Mugabe) was that the AU, which by the way was still very confused by the whole situation and how to fit it within its theoretical taxonomy on coups, would then have no option, but to describe it as a coup, in which case calls for military intervention would then have credence.</seg>
<seg id="17">That was the spirit and calculation within which the offer was made.</seg>
<seg id="18">Officials said Mugabe made the move when he realised that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.</seg>
<seg id="19">They said Mugabe was forced to write a resignation letter after the military had warned the strongman that he risked a Gadaffi-style lynching.</seg>
<seg id="20">Military bosses told him they would not turn their guns on citizens if they marched to his Blue Roof residence.</seg>
<seg id="21">And at that instant Mugabe had two desires, to save his family and also to prove that the military had taken over power," the official said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then CDF and commanders correctly read (the) calculation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The emissary (Gono) of that desperate message was told -- through a powerful metaphor -- that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the sect of camouflages, that is, the military); we are not politicians or (in) political competition, the senior government official said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Government officials say the army had communicated to other military bosses in the region through attachés who were in Zimbabwe that their intentions were not to topple Mugabe, but to deal with "criminals" around him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mugabe also tried to use the same strategy to lure Mnangagwa back from short exile in South Africa so that they could have a discussion on the coup and succession.</seg>
<seg id="26">Apart from negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought help from the region.</seg>
<seg id="27">The South Africans, who were key to the process -- not least because of their economic and regional power, but also because the then president Jacob Zuma was the Sadc chairperson -- refused to intervene, but made it clear that if the army had invaded Mugabe's house, as they were threatening repeatedly in the background, South African troops would have arrived in Harare in no time.</seg>
<seg id="28">"That did not work because Putin and African leaders did not prefer that route," a source told the Independent.</seg>

<seg id="2">China needs the strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party or the country will "crumble," the government said in a policy paper released on Friday ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.</seg>
<seg id="3">China's cabinet news office said in a white paper that the country's success since the Communists took power 70 years ago was down to the party's leadership.</seg>
<seg id="4">China is huge in size, has complex national conditions, and its governance difficulties are rarely seen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Without a unified and strong leadership force, China will move toward division and crumble, bringing disaster to the world," it said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese authorities have long justified a firm fist in dealing with problems, like the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, as being necessary for national stability.</seg>
<seg id="7">Strong-arm President Xi Jinping, who will headline the anniversary celebrations of the world's second-biggest economy on Tuesday, has further tightened party rule and cracked down on those who may challenge authority since taking office in late 2012.</seg>
<seg id="8">Xi has also overseen a military modernization program that has unnerved the region.</seg>
<seg id="9">China does not seek to export its development model nor want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace and not "hegemony," the policy paper said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Chinese people do not have it in their genes to invade others or dominate the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">In modern times, China has been bullied by the Great Powers, war and turmoil have left a deep impression with the suffering caused; China will never impose the sufferings it has been through on other peoples.</seg>
<seg id="12">China is marking the anniversary at a time of uncertainty for the country, which is locked in a bitter trade war with the United States and faces challenges from a slowing economy as well as anti-government protests in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="13">China will never "trade away" its core interests and not allow its security and sovereignty to be compromised, the paper said.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The threat of trade wars and the continued increase in tariffs are not conducive to solving problems," it said, in reference to its trade disputes with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="15">China is a mature economy with a complete industrial system, complete industrial chain, broad market space and strong economic development momentum.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It will never be weakened by trade wars," the paper added.</seg>
<seg id="17">China is confident that it has the ability to face difficulties, turn crises into opportunities, and open up a new world.</seg>
<seg id="18">The United States should look rationally at China's development, as China has no intention of challenging the United States and does not want to replace the United States, it added.</seg>
<seg id="19">The United States cannot control China, and it is even more unlikely to stop China's development.</seg>
<seg id="20">Curbing and suppressing other countries and transferring domestic contradictions abroad will not keep the United States strong.</seg>

<seg id="1">Court decision on same-sex marriage an opportunity to expand diversity: Hokkaido Shimbun Newspaper Doshin Online Edition</seg>
<seg id="2">The Moka Branch of Utsunomiya District Court has ruled favourably in a lawsuit over whether a "de facto marriage (common-law marriage)" equivalent to marriage can come into existence between couples of the same sex.</seg>
<seg id="3">Over 20 countries around the globe now permit same-sex marriage, and even at home, though it has no legal effect, the number of local governments that recognize same-sex partnerships, like Sapporo, are on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="4">Based on this, the court ruled that the two women in the case were in fact married.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is significant because it is the first time a court in Japan has ruled to grant legal protection to a same-sex couple.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lawsuits seeking damages from the state on the grounds that it is unconstitutional to deny same-sex marriage based on the provisions of the Civil Code and Family Registration Law have been filed in five district courts, including Sapporo.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is hoped that this ruling will deepen understanding of rights protection for sexual minorities, and encourage discussion on how a more inclusive legal system that recognizes more diverse families should be.</seg>
<seg id="8">The women at the centre of the lawsuit had lived together for around seven years and had obtained a marriage certificate in US, but later split when one partner's infidelity was discovered, and now the plaintiff was seeking damages from her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="9">Based on their time spent living together, the court found that "their actual circumstances were no different from that of a man and woman living together in a common-law marriage".</seg>
<seg id="10">The result of this groundbreaking decision extends the rights of common-law marriage, which for social insurance and other purposes confers the same rights as traditional marriage, to same-sex couples.</seg>
<seg id="11">An even more important implication is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution, which stipulates the freedom to marry, stating, "Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes".</seg>
<seg id="12">It was the view of the court that the inclusion of the wording "both sexes" was because, "Same-sex marriage was not envisioned at the time the Constitution was drawn up, but one cannot go so far as to interpret this as meaning that same-sex marriage is denied."</seg>
<seg id="13">The government has not explicitly said whether or not same-sex marriage is prohibited, but pointing out that the Constitution did not even conceive of same-sex marriages could be used to pin them down, and may bode well for other court cases concerning same-sex marriages around the country.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the other hand, issues still remain though, as the amount of reparation was reduced due to the fact that same-sex marriage is not approved and therefore the extent of legal protection differs to that available between a man and a woman.</seg>
<seg id="15">One could argue that it makes no sense to differentiate the rights to be protected while at the same time recognizing that the circumstances were the same as that of a man and woman who are together.</seg>
<seg id="16">A national survey investigating family trends that was asked to married women revealed a shift in the national consciousness, as over 70% responded that they thought same-sex marriages should be permitted by law.</seg>
<seg id="17">As lifestyles diversify, if the law is tied to the traditional image of the family, it will encroach on the rights of people who cannot be pigeonholed in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Since people in common-law marriages are not regarded as "spouses" by the law, there are still various restrictions, such as lack of tax benefits and inability to have joint custody.</seg>
<seg id="19">In considering same-sex marriage, it will surely become necessary to review the laws governing the rights within families from various perspectives, not just allowing same-sex couples to marry, but also expanding the legal rights conferred to common-law marriages.</seg>

<seg id="2">The home run was like a repayment to the older players who taught him.</seg>
<seg id="3">Entering the 4th inning with a one-point lead, Ota hit a liner into the left wing seats, securing his 20th home run of the season.</seg>
<seg id="4">Reacting on having achieved the number of home runs he was aiming for, Ota spoke with pride, "I will learn from this accomplishment and continue to progress through trial and error. This home run meant a lot to me."</seg>
<seg id="5">Ota was also able to carry out Manager Kuriyama's plan ably.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was the first time he was assigned to the cleanup spot since transferring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kuriyama had told Ota that he'd entered him as the 4th batter so he could "swing away with all his might".</seg>
<seg id="8">Ota certainly lived up to expectations, saying, "That encouraged me, and I entered the game with great enthusiasm. I spent the whole day genuinely excited."</seg>
<seg id="9">One of his ideal players to play in the position of 4th batter is the Giants' Shinnosuke Abe, who will retire this season.</seg>
<seg id="10">He explains, "(The 4th batter) is the core of the team, that can lead it to victory. It's the team's 4th batter that produces results every day. All the older players who were 4th batters that I observed when I was with the Giants were like that."</seg>
<seg id="11">Among them, "Abe in particular springs to mind. He had a reliable presence, and I learned from watching him, which allowed me to develop my own style."</seg>

<seg id="1">Video reveals tourist hotspot as heavily polluted</seg>
<seg id="2">Surrounded by the Opera House, Circular Quay, Luna Park and of course the iconic Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour is the major contributor to the $21.9 billion Sydney tourism pumps into Australia's economy each year.</seg>
<seg id="3">But beneath the bridge lies an ugly truth.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sydney's famous harbour is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, receiving around 15 Olympic-size swimming pools of pollutants each year.</seg>
<seg id="5">This horrific statistic makes one of our greatest tourism drawcards also one of our dirtiest.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to a new video, titled Sydney Harbour Above and Below, the waters around Australia's most popular city is filled with cigarette butts, plastic bags and bottles, lost shoes and clothing and even dead animals - all coming into the harbour from stormwater run-off.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the biggest component choking our waterways is plastic.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I would call it a paradox," Dr Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program said in the video, which was released to coincide with World Tourism Day on September 27.</seg>
<seg id="9">It does look beautiful, but it is one of the more modified and polluted estuaries along our coastline.</seg>
<seg id="10">The CSIRO estimates around 1560kg of plastic enters our waterways each hour, most of it coming into the harbour through stormwater drains.</seg>
<seg id="11">"After we have some of these really big rainfall events, the harbour ... it's quite tragic," Dr Dafforn said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Two thirds of our pollution comes from stormwater run-off.</seg>
<seg id="13">But like an iceberg, the problem on Sydney's harbour is far bigger below the surface, with the seabed receiving 70 per cent of plastics that enter the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Unless you spend time under the water, I don't think you get a true appreciation of what is below there," Richard Nicholls, owner of Dive Centre Manly said, noting he and his team pull out around 500kg of plastic on their own each year.</seg>
<seg id="15">I think if more people knew (what was under the water) they would just be horrified.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overwhelmingly ... over half of everything we find is plastic bags.</seg>
<seg id="17">The other 50 per cent is at least made out of plastic.</seg>
<seg id="18">When you look at the harbour it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that we get all of this plastic and all of this rubbish just under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of the Ocean Protect, said there were ways people - both locals and visitors alike - could help to ease the amount of plastic and debris entering our waterways.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It has to start at the source," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have to reduce the amount of plastic that we are using, recycle better and be more conscious about what is going down our drains which ultimately ends up in our oceans.</seg>
<seg id="22">If we ruin the ocean, we are going to kill ourselves because 50 per cent of the oxygen we breathe in comes from the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="23">It absorbs 30 per cent of carbon dioxide and our food source.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we can fix this harbour and bring it back to where it was, but it's pretty simple.</seg>
<seg id="25">If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="26">The video, which was funded by recycling company TOMRA as part of their broader efforts to educate Australians on protecting the environment and reducing the impact of drink containers that can often end up in nature, coincides with a study about plastic and mental health that was also released this month.</seg>
<seg id="27">A new survey of 546 children aged 12 to 18 years found 82 per cent felt hopeless about plastic waste and 25 per cent blamed adults for the single-use plastic waste problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">The study revealed plastic waste was also the fourth biggest concern for parents, with 93 per cent of 551 parents surveyed saying they are increasingly worried about the level of plastic waste entering the oceans.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste but just didn't know how to make a difference, which was leading to eco-anxiety.</seg>

<seg id="2">The chimneys of the former Karatsu power station, Futago, Karatsu, due to be dismantled starting in October</seg>
<seg id="3">Kyushu Electric Power announced on the 26th that it will begin dismantling the chimneys of the former Karatsu power plant (petrothermal) in Futago, Karatsu, in October.</seg>
<seg id="4">The dismantling work is expected to be finished before the end of March 2021.</seg>
<seg id="5">The two chimneys to be dismantled both stand around 180m high, and were used to discharge gas when the plant was in operation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Originally, there were three, but one was demolished in 1991 due to dilapidation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The chimneys will be taken down one at a time, using a tower crane to take them apart from the top down.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the plans for the project, the dismantling will take nine months per chimney, a total of 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="9">The schedule for demolishing the remaining turbine hall and boiler has yet to be decided.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some people have expressed regret at the dismantling, with a man in his 60s who runs a restaurant nearby saying, "When I return from a long trip and see the chimneys, they're like a symbol that makes me feel like I'm back in Karatsu. I'll be sad to see them go."</seg>
<seg id="11">The Karatsu power plant started operation in 1967, with the unit 1 combustion chamber being abolished in 1989, and the unit 2 and 3 chambers following in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">It occupies a site approximately 225,000m族 in area in one part of Karatsu Higashi Port.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both the prefectural yacht harbour and JR Nishi-Karatsu Station are located nearby, so the prefecture and city hope to be able to make use of the site.</seg>
<seg id="14">The city, prefecture and Kyushu Electric Power signed an agreement in 2015 over how the site is to be used.</seg>

<seg id="3">[Owase] Four third-year pupils studying IT business at Owase Prefectural High School in Kodono-cho, Owase, Mie Prefecture, have developed fish nuggets and rice cooked with bream using locally caught fish.</seg>
<seg id="4">They went on to sell them at the school's culture festival on the 26th.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their efforts form part of Mie University's East Kishu Satellite High School and University Collaboration Project, which is working to revitalize local industries in the East Kishu region, such as fishing and forestry.</seg>
<seg id="6">The products they developed are fish nuggets that use minced gnomefish caught in the Kumano Sea and rice cooked with cultured bream from Owase.</seg>
<seg id="7">The pupils said they had young target audiences in mind.</seg>
<seg id="8">They prepared three kinds of fish nuggets, including one kind with added tofu, and one kind made with tofu and greasyback prawns from Owase.</seg>
<seg id="9">They had the cooperation of the Kumano Fisheries Cooperative, which prepared the minced fish in one of their processing plants in Yuki-cho, Kumano.</seg>
<seg id="10">The rice cooked with bream was mixed with shitake mushrooms and carrot.</seg>
<seg id="11">The cooking was overseen by Owase Fish Market Ototo (Kodono-cho, Owase), which is directly managed by Owase Produce, a fishery in Hayashi-machi, Owase.</seg>
<seg id="12">The class began back in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">During this time, there were visits to factories that process produce from Owase, and understanding of the fishing industry was deepened.</seg>
<seg id="14">In workshops, they discussed consumer needs and tried sample food products.</seg>
<seg id="15">Originally, nuggets with horse mackerel were considered, but eventually gnomefish was used because horse mackerel had a particular fish smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">Yamaguchi Masaki (17) says, "We made a product that even people who don't like fish can enjoy. I'd be really glad if many people come and eat it."</seg>
<seg id="17">They are currently in discussions with local tourist facilities to have them sell their products.</seg>

<seg id="3">Mentor's advice that was a lifesaver in the worst of times</seg>
<seg id="4">To me, the actor Takahashi Hideki was like a mentor to me, beyond being my father.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even though we were in the same industry, my father is an actor, and I am a presenter.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although our jobs are different, it was my father who showed me the work ethic and the rules in the industry and what is important as a member of society and a person.</seg>
<seg id="7">When I was devastated after being called "nepotism hire" and "ugly", even though I gave my 120% to get hired as a presenter for a TV station, my father told me to "work hard enough so people will say that 'although nepotism was assumed, that wasn't the case and Maasa got the job because of her ability'".</seg>
<seg id="8">2-3 years into my job, when I had a hard time keeping my motivation up and was very discouraged because all the jobs I was assigned to were "for any unassigned female announcer", and I could not get the jobs I wanted to do, my father told me to "especially work hard on jobs that anyone could do, that way it will change to "even though it could have been anyone, It was great having Maasa do it, let's ask for her next time'", and I was able to change my mindset and I worked even harder, slowly leading to a positive change.</seg>

<seg id="11">I believe a newscaster's personality and taste also show when reading news articles, and Matsuko Deluxe has praised me saying "Maasa's news reading is very skillful," which made me really happy and boosted my confidence.</seg>
<seg id="12">When reading news, I think "pause" is what dictates importance and flair.</seg>
<seg id="13">I learned from a young age watching my father on stage, in movies, in TV shows and in historical dramas, how to take a breath at punctuations and between sentences as well as when to pause.</seg>
<seg id="14">To elaborate, I attribute my ability to present myself and respond accordingly at variety shows to many enriching experiences as a child thanks to my father.</seg>

<seg id="4">A Kumi-odori Dance workshop (organized by the Prefectural Board of Education), part of the 2019 Kumi-odori Dance Education Program, was held at Kyohara Junior High School on the 26th.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pupils from all grades attended, and learned about the dance's origins and 300-year history, as well as the sound effects of the various musical instruments and how they are employed in performance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Members of the Alumni Club who majored in Ryukyuan Performing Arts at Okinawa Prefectural University of Arts came to the workshop and demonstrated through performance the roles that the sanshin, koto, taiko, kokyu and flute play in the dance.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leading the workshop was Kawamitsu Kota, a member of the Alumni Club who hails from Miyakojima, who explained the charms of the Kumi-odori Dance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Three elements make up the dance (music, singing and Ryukyuan dance), and this workshop focused on the element of music, giving the pupils a chance to learn what kind of things the five types of instruments express during the dance.</seg>
<seg id="9">For instance, it was explained how the sanshin is a component that expresses the thoughts and emotions of the characters along with the song, whereas the kokyu follows and complements the melody of the song and the sanshin.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the second half, pupils were given the opportunity to actually touch the instruments, experience their tone, and appreciate their beauty as musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="11">This program is run with the aim of familiarising pupils with classical Ryukyuan music through musical instruments and getting them interested in Kumi-odori Dance; this is the first time the workshop was held in Miyako.</seg>

<seg id="3">Medical researchers found how some cancer cells can camouflage themselves</seg>
<seg id="4">Researchers found the same process happens in Tasmanian Devils and humans</seg>
<seg id="5">The discovery is hoped to provide new methods to treat cancer patients</seg>
<seg id="6">What do Tasmanian devils and humans have in common?</seg>
<seg id="7">Cancer cells that can turn invisible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Researchers, including from Melbourne's Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, have found a breakthrough which could help revolutionise treatment for some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="9">It may also hold the key to tackling deadly facial tumours threatening the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.</seg>
<seg id="10">The study tracked the way some cancer cells in both humans and the marsupial camouflage themselves using a group of proteins known as PRC2, switching off a marker which would otherwise alert the immune system to attack the cancer.</seg>
<seg id="11">This can be a major challenge in treating small-cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and a type of skin cancer known as Merkel cell.</seg>
<seg id="12">'The huge significance from this project is that (in) patients who sometimes become resistant to immunotherapies, we might be able to reverse that process,' lead Peter Mac researcher Mark Dawson told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="13">Existing treatments could be repurposed to switch back on the markers, proteins known as MHC, allowing the immune system to recognise the cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="14">'Potentially, this has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer,' Prof Dawson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">'It's one of the most prevalent diseases across the globe.</seg>
<seg id="16">And we may be able to treat this in a far better way.</seg>
<seg id="17">Researchers also hope the discovery could eventually be used against Tasmanian devil facial tumours, where cancer cells avoid detection in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="18">'Remarkably, exactly the same process happens (in human and Tasmanian devil cancers),' Prof Dawson said.</seg>
<seg id="19">'Thus far it's been very difficult to treat the Tasmanian devil tumours.</seg>
<seg id="20">But if the drugs that work in humans can also be used in Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this may help with the control of the disease.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists puzzled by really big planet orbiting really little star</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists are expressing surprise after discovering a solar system 30 light-years away from Earth that defies current understanding about planet formation, with a large Jupiter-like planet orbiting a diminutive star known as a red dwarf.</seg>
<seg id="3">An artistic impression of the gas giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting its red dwarf host star, released on September 26, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stars generally are much bigger than even the largest planets that orbit them.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in this case, the star and the planet are not much different in size, the researchers said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The star, called GJ 3512, is about 12% the size of our sun, while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of Jupiter, our solar system's largest planet.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Yes, an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, who led the research published in the journal Science.</seg>
<seg id="8">The discovery was surprising because theoretical formation models suggest that low-mass stars typically host small planets, similar to Earth or small Neptunes.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this case, we have found a gas giant planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star," Morales added.</seg>
<seg id="10">The planet, which like Jupiter is composed mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.</seg>
<seg id="11">It travels around its star in a very elliptical orbit lasting 204 days.</seg>
<seg id="12">Red dwarfs are small, with relatively low surface temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="13">GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than our sun, it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet, being only about 35% bigger than Jupiter.</seg>
<seg id="14">They emit less energy, so they are fainter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather cool, below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit/3,527 Celsius) approximately.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is why they have a reddish color," Morales said.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star, while a third planet might have been ejected from the star system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of the Jupiter-like planet, Morales said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Planets are born from the same disk of interstellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit.</seg>
<seg id="18">Under the leading model for planetary formation, called the "core accretion" model, an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tug of this embryonic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gas.</seg>
<seg id="19">A competing model, called the gravitational instability model, may explain this unusual system.</seg>
<seg id="20">"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold," Morales said.</seg>
<seg id="21">This makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear.</seg>
<seg id="22">These clumps can grow until they collapse, forming a planet.</seg>

<seg id="2">Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38, is accused of giving meth-laced bean dip to a co-worker.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez, of Albany, was charged with delivery of methamphetamine and causing another person to ingest a controlled substance, both Class B felonies.</seg>
<seg id="4">The charges stemmed from an incident that happened Sept. 9 at a Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.</seg>
<seg id="5">A 27-year-old co-worker of the suspect told Marion County Sheriff's Deputies that she went to the deli to get lunch when she saw Medina-Hernandez making bean dip and asked to try some, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by OregonLive.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">The victim, who told investigators she had never taken meth before, "thought one of the bites she ate tasted odd, but she did not think anything of it," according to the affidavit.</seg>
<seg id="7">When the woman returned to work, she had an upset stomach and her feet were unsteady.</seg>
<seg id="8">She went to a local hospital where it was determined the bean dip may have contained methamphetamine, according to the Albany Democrat-Herald.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police said that another Thriftway employee said Medina-Hernandez "told her about placing drugs inside" the victim's food, while a third worker said the suspect had messaged her claiming the meth was placed in the bean dip by accident, according to The Smoking Gun.</seg>
<seg id="10">OregonLive reports surveillance video obtained from the deli allegedly shows Medina-Hernandez remove something from inside her bra while her back is to the camera and go behind a microwave and lean down.</seg>
<seg id="11">She then allegedly wiped her nose after she stood up, walked to a table and placed bean dip in a small paper dish.</seg>
<seg id="12">The item retrieved from her bra also appeared to be on the plate, police said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sheriff's officials said there is currently no reason to believe any customers were served contaminated food, according to the Oregon Statesman-Journal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Medina-Hernandez is being held in the Marion County jail in lieu of $520,000 bail.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her lengthy rap sheet shows she was previously convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, delivery of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine, and felon in possession of a restricted weapon, according to The Smoking Gun.</seg>

<seg id="2">At a press conference on the 27th, Kaneko Shin, president of the Central Japan Railway Company, speaking about the issue of decreased flow in the Oi River due to construction of a tunnel for the Linear Chuo Shinkansen through the Southern Alps said, "It's important to sort out what needs to be done before construction starts, and what can be done once construction starts," reaffirming his position to start construction work early.</seg>
<seg id="3">Specifically, he only said that they would "talk at the meeting and at the stage before it".</seg>
<seg id="4">President Kaneko said, "If you sort out every single problem in advance, it makes it hard to get round to starting construction." Therefore, I believe we can make that kind of distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">Although he did state, "This is our way of thinking. We still need to speak (to the prefecture)."</seg>
<seg id="6">There are strong concerns from prefecture officials that spring water that wells up during the tunnel construction will not be able to be fully returned to the Oi River.</seg>
<seg id="7">Asked whether they would change the construction method to deal with this, Kaneko replied that they would do something if there was a realistic option, but believed it would be difficult in terms of safety at the construction site.</seg>
<seg id="8">He contested the route change suggested by Governor Heita Kawakatsu, saying that it was "impossible".</seg>
<seg id="9">Regarding the impact it might have on the opening of the line, President Kaneko named the Southern Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station and Nagoya Station as three places where construction would take a particularly long time, stating, "Though it can hardly be said that we have leeway (elsewhere), I'm most concerned about the Shizuoka stretch of the construction."</seg>

<seg id="2">To offer support for the recovery of areas affected by the heavy rains in West Japan, seven coaches from nations including Scotland and Wales, currently in Japan for the Rugby World Cup, descended on six elementary schools in the Mabi district of Kurashiki on the 27th, interacting with the children and teaching them the fun of rugby.</seg>
<seg id="3">The event was planned by a volunteer organisation in Tokyo that is engaged in meet-and-greet opportunities with players around the country, in an effort to drum-up excitement before the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Kawabe Elementary School, which currently has a temporary school building on the grounds of Sono Elementary School, Richard Underwood (42), who coaches a club team in Scotland, and three others met with 54 3rd-graders in the gymnasium.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the names of hospitals which are in need of reorganisation or consolidation, including five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thirteen medical institutions in the prefecture were surveyed, accounting for 38.5%, the tenth highest amount in the country, and, of those, three hospitals are already set to be consolidated or relocated.</seg>
<seg id="4">The hospitals named from Saga Prefecture are the National Hospital Organization East Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyaki-gun), Taku City Hospital (Taku), Ogi City Hospital (Ogi), JCHO Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari) and Tara-cho, Fujitsu-gun's Tara Town Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the five, Taku City Hospital and Ogi City Hospital are being merged and a plan is underway to build a new hospital in Higashitaku-cho, Taku, whereas Imari Matsuura Hospital is set to relocate to Matsuura in Nagasaki Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tara Town Hospital plays a central role in the town's comprehensive community care, and has been in the black for the past several years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Commenting on the situation, Mayor Nagafuchi Takayuki said, "We have always run the hospital independently as a town, and are considering working with other hospitals in nearby towns. A hospital must be preserved for the sake of the citizens," expressing his negative view on the prospect of restructuring or merging.</seg>
<seg id="8">The administrator of East Saga Hospital said that they are yet to hear anything from the prefecture, but did mention that they were in active talks at community healthcare coordination meetings, and intended to act based on those discussions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Japan Community Healthcare Organisation (Tokyo) that operates Imari Matsuura Hospital did not seem overly concerned, stating, "It is our understanding that this announcement does not automatically determine the direction of public hospitals, but is more of a request to reconsider the position of hospitals at community healthcare coordination meetings in each and every prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="10">The person from the prefectural medical affairs department, who is responsible for explaining the state's way of thinking to each medical institution, made it plain that, "We want to carefully consider what the parties concerned have to say about future hospital management.</seg>
<seg id="11">In some cases, we may ask hospitals to review their departments, or further reduce the number of beds."</seg>

<seg id="3">This is usually made easier by the Royal Plane - a private aircraft which jets the family around the globe to important events and appearances.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unsurprisingly, having their own private plane comes with its own perks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Aside not having to wait in long security lines and an unlimited number of bags, it seems the Royal Family can invite onboard any guests they wish - including some unlikely passengers.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to a recently premiered Channel 5 documentary, the Queen and Prince Phillip aren't the only frequent fliers aboard the Royal Plane.</seg>
<seg id="7">During the programme 'Secrets of the Royal Flight', a former Navigator of the Queen's Flight revealed that there are also often a number of furrier guests alongside the family.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bob Shields said: "Occasionally, as well as our very important royal passengers, we might have some very important royal dogs."</seg>
<seg id="9">It's no surprise that the Queen might request her beloved pets to come along for the journey, as she is renowned for her deep affinity for Corgis.</seg>
<seg id="10">From a young age Queen Elizabeth has been fond of the four legged creatures, rumoured to have owned more than 30 corgis since she was crowned Monarch.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2007 she is believed to have had five corgis named Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.</seg>
<seg id="12">They were joined by five cocker spaniels: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, and an additional four dachshund-corgi crossbreeds: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.</seg>
<seg id="13">Staff on board the Royal Plane certainly had their hands full.</seg>
<seg id="14">The household member of staff would be seen taking the dogs to the grass and pleading with the dogs to please do their business before they went on board the aeroplane, continued Shields.</seg>
<seg id="15">I am delighted to say we never had one accident.</seg>
<seg id="16">The programme also revealed the shocking amount of luggage the Queen has been known to travel with while on duty.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the shows narrator: "For her 44,000 mile commonwealth tour in 1953 The Queen's luggage weighed 12 tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="18">To put that into perspective, that is roughly the same as two large elephants.</seg>

<seg id="2">Michelle Obama gave high praise to Meghan Markle in a sweet Instagram on Thursday, calling the Duchess of Sussex "a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it."</seg>
<seg id="3">The duchess and Prince Harry, now on a 10-day royal tour of South Africa with their baby son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a youth reception earlier this week and met Obama Foundation leaders.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Thank you to my friend, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it," the former first lady wrote in her glowing post.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Whether meeting with our @ObamaFoundation Leaders or helping girls around the world seek the education they deserve, she is an inspiration to so many," Obama added, alongside a photo of a smiling Meghan posing with foundation leaders.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, which the former "Suits" actress guest-edited.</seg>
<seg id="7">In their candid chat, the former first lady reflected on motherhood and how it's changed her.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Being a mother has been a masterclass in letting go," Obama said in the interview.</seg>
<seg id="9">Motherhood has taught me that, most of the time, my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be.</seg>
<seg id="10">Not who I want them to be or who I wish I was at that age, but who they are, deep inside.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obama, who knows first-hand the pressure of being under a global spotlight, doled out some advice to the duchess in an interview with Good Housekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The pressure you feel ― from yourself and from others ― can sometimes feel like a lot," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">So my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don't be in a hurry to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="14">I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work.</seg>
<seg id="15">I think it's okay - it's good, even - to do that.</seg>

<seg id="2">WASHINGTON (AP) - The Washington Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has dismissed a request to review whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its liquor license over its owner's character.</seg>
<seg id="3">The agency ruled Wednesday that the complaint by three ministers, two retired judges and two rabbis lacked standing because most of them didn't live in or own property in the District.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Washington Post reports this is the second time the complainants pushed for the revocation of the hotel's liquor license over a District law that says license applicants must be of "good character."</seg>
<seg id="5">The initial complaint filed last summer says President Donald Trump violates that law, citing assault allegations and patterns of deception.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was killed because the license had already been granted.</seg>
<seg id="7">The second complaint was prompted by the license's renewal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The first harvest of honey from the "Flying Bees", honeybees kept by Bentley</seg>
<seg id="2">What does the honey collected by the bees raised under the wing of the Flying B taste like?</seg>
<seg id="3">Permanent beekeeping began on the site of the Bentley factory in Crewe in May 2019, and honey was harvested for the first time in September of that year.</seg>
<seg id="4">The bees are just as hardworking as the staff working at the Crewe factory, producing enough honey to fill over 100 jars between just two hives.</seg>
<seg id="5">But why did Bentley start keeping bees on the same site as the factory that assembles its cars?</seg>
<seg id="6">You'll want to try this!</seg>
<seg id="7">Click here to see Bentley's honey (11 photos)</seg>
<seg id="8">Bentley's member of the board for manufacturing, Peter Bosch, explains.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In order to do our part in conserving the biodiversity of the local area, we installed two beehives on the expansive grounds of the Crewe factory for the first time at the beginning of this year.</seg>
<seg id="10">The beekeepers have watched over the bees as they gathered nectar from the wildflowers growing onsite and in the nearby fields and hills.</seg>
<seg id="11">We realized that this location is ideal for beekeeping, and it's wonderful to have ended up with such a large amount of honey in the first year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Through our efforts at the Crewe factory and in our other business activities, Bentley is committed to a wide range of activities as the lead sustainable car manufacturer, and beekeeping is just one example.</seg>
<seg id="13">The staff are also actively getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are delighted to have had a successful first harvest, and plan to install more hives next year, so that we can increase the yield of Bentley honey.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is a first small step towards conserving the biodiversity of the local area.</seg>
<seg id="16">We will also continue with various initiatives appropriate for our role." Bentley started its beekeeping with 120,000 "Flying Bees" in May 2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">One summer later, in September, the frames were removed from the hive and put in a centrifuge, and the resulting honey was then filtered and jarred.</seg>
<seg id="18">The honey jars and packaging also exhibit Bentley's characteristic commitment to detail.</seg>
<seg id="19">The label was designed by Bentley's interior designer, Louise McCallum.</seg>
<seg id="20">The jars of honey are not only shared with employees, but are also given as gifts to important guests and customers when they visit the Crewe factory.</seg>
<seg id="21">England is a country that places great importance on the custom of afternoon tea.</seg>
<seg id="22">It seems like it would be nice to enjoy some "Flying Bees" honey with a scone and a cup of fennel tea that goes well with honey.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nancy Pelosi: William Barr has 'gone rogue' and impeachment investigation needs to take its course</seg>
<seg id="2">You never know where we're going next.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, I think we're getting involved in the coverup of the coverup, and that may be something that will take some time to investigate," Pelosi said in an interview with CNN on Capitol Hill.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They will do the work that they're set out to do, following the facts and the time that it takes to find the facts," she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">A White House transcript released this week showed that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate, and Biden's son.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump also asked Zelensky to work with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani on the issue, the call transcript revealed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trump has denied he did anything improper.</seg>
<seg id="8">CNN reported on Thursday that Justice Department national security lawyers were first alerted to the whistleblower complaint regarding Trump's conduct involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal referral.</seg>
<seg id="9">After receiving the complaint as a referral from the intelligence community officials, the DOJ determined that Trump's phone call did not warrant a campaign finance criminal investigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said Friday the Intelligence Committee will decide who to call as witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="11">But she added that she believes Barr "has gone rogue."</seg>
<seg id="12">He has for a long time now.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since (Barr) was mentioned in all of this," Pelosi said, referring to Trump's mention of his attorney general on the July call with Ukraine's leader.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's curious that he would be making decisions about how the complaint would be handled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Pelosi said she's "very worried" about the whistleblower's sources, whom Trump attacked on Thursday as spies and suggested that in the old days spies were dealt with differently.</seg>
<seg id="16">I think what the President said goes beyond irresponsible, it's dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Our whistleblowers have an important role to play in unfolding -- revealing wrongdoing in our government," Pelosi said, adding, "For the President to say what he said about those who may have supplied information to the whistleblower seriously undermines integrity in government."</seg>
<seg id="18">On Tuesday, Pelosi took the historic step of announcing a formal impeachment inquiry over the allegations that he attempted to pressure a foreign leader for political gain.</seg>
<seg id="19">The phone call was included in a complaint publicly released Thursday, in which a whistleblower alleged Trump abused his powers to "solicit interference" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election.</seg>
<seg id="20">The whistleblower also alleged that White House lawyers directed officials to remove the transcript of the call from a computer system that stores them for Cabinet-level officials and instead put the transcript in a system for especially sensitive information.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to the survey, 9.2% of the students answered that they've had sexual experience.</seg>
<seg id="4">They also found that about one in five students were not using contraception.</seg>
<seg id="5">The survey was conducted in 2017, on students enrolled in high school, vocational schools and colleges of technology.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mr. Kofi Manu, a football administrator and an official of Sekondi Hasaacas has raised concerns over the composition of the Vetting Committee for the upcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA) elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">He questioned the inclusion of the Committee's Chairman, Mr. Frank Davies, adding that he was not happy with his inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr. Manu in an interview with the GNA Sport said, he had doubts the Chairman of the Committee would be fair since he had interest in the outcome of the vetting process.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Vetting Committee should be neutral people from outside who have not shown affiliation with any member and who have not shown interest before.</seg>
<seg id="6">For instance, Mr. Davies was contracted by the NC as a lawyer to write to Osei Kwaku Palmer concerning a 10 per cent payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">He is also a known Olympics supporter.</seg>
<seg id="8">For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to serve on the vetting committee because he has interest," he argued.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Manu said there would be conflict of interest on the Chairman's part if Mr. Fred Pappoe, a Director of Olympics appear before the Committee because of his affiliation to the club whilst suggesting there would be prejudice and partiality towards Mr. Palmer if he appeared before the Committee.</seg>
<seg id="10">Members of the Committee were expected to begin work from yesterday and end on October 4 after being sworn in at a ceremony held at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Thursday September 19.</seg>
<seg id="11">The chairman of the Committee is Mr. Frank Davies with Corporate Governance Consultant and legal practitioner, Mrs. Marian Barnor and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwah as members.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Regarding the government's target of raising the minimum wage to 1,000 yen per hour, an investigation carried out by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that 54.2% of small to medium businesses in Fukui Prefecture think that the minimum wage can be 1,000 yen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite 90% of businesses carrying out recruitment drives in the 2018 financial year, of the companies that said they were able to secure the required number of labourers, regular employees - whether recently graduated or switching jobs mid-career - made up around 50% of this amount, whilst the recruitment of non-regular employees accounted for 30%, exposing the emerging struggle for companies to secure labour.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of the companies who answered that they were in favour of raising the hourly wage to 1,000 yen, IT-related (100%), construction (70.6%) and wholesale (61.7%) companies were in the majority.</seg>
<seg id="4">Conversely, respondents with a majority opposed to this move came from the manufacturing (51.9%) and hospitality - including dining and accommodation (60.9%) industries, whereas the transportation industry was split 50/50 for and against.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to a representative from the Chamber of Commerce, "The kinds of industries with a lot of part-time workers or staff paid by the hour tended to be more opposed to the idea, but as it is difficult to secure personnel, many companies are actually looking to increase their labour costs."</seg>
<seg id="6">The hourly wage deemed acceptable by companies opposed to the increase to 1,000 yen averaged to 895 yen (In Fukui Prefecture, it is 829 yen from October 4th).</seg>
<seg id="7">When asked about the state of recruitment in March 2019, 61.3% of companies hired recently graduated regular employees, 54.5% hired workers switching jobs mid-career, and 15.4% hired non-regular employees.</seg>
<seg id="8">8.6% did not recruit at all.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of the companies that said they were able to secure the required number of employees, recent graduates accounted for 44.7%, workers switching jobs mid-career accounted for 50.3%, and non-regular employees accounted for 31.1%.</seg>
<seg id="10">In particular, the transportation industry (13.3% new graduates, 37.5% mid-career) and the construction industry (24.1% new graduates, 38.1% mid-career) struggled.</seg>
<seg id="11">Overall, 86.4% of the companies encountered issues in the recruitment process, with the most commonly cited problems being the low number of applicants, the relatively unknown status of the company, and the inability to offer better wage conditions, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many expressed the wish for the government to update its policy regarding employment activity, asking for more information sharing and strengthened recruitment programs for second-wave graduates (employees who leave a position within three years of graduating) and mid-career employees.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others suggested the need to boost the approach towards students through the support of various internships and the provision of PR opportunities to encourage students from outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="14">Regarding second jobs and side business as advocated by the national growth strategy, 15.3% of companies responded that they had already approved of this.</seg>
<seg id="15">Including the 20.3% of respondents who indicated that they planned to approve of this in the future, this reveals that one third of all respondents showed an approving attitude.</seg>
<seg id="16">64.4% of companies answered that they did not approve, with the highest percentage coming from the construction industry (82.8%), retail industry (73.1%) and manufacturing industry (72.7%).</seg>
<seg id="17">The survey was conducted from July 19th to August 2nd, targeting 1,000 member companies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of those, responses were received from 298 companies (29.8%).</seg>

<seg id="2">Justin Tipuric says "it is time to perform" when Wales face a World Cup showdown against Australia that could shape their destiny in the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="3">Victory for Wales against the Wallabies would install them as red-hot favourites to win Pool D and secure a likely quarter-final appointment with France or Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="4">But if Australia beat Wales for a 14th time in the last 15 meetings, it could send Tipuric and company hurtling towards a last-eight clash against England.</seg>
<seg id="5">"There is no bones about it, both teams want to try and get through and finish top of the group," Wales flanker Tipuric said.</seg>
<seg id="6">There have been some tough results in the past, but it was nice to get a win last autumn against them (Australia).</seg>
<seg id="7">I think they will be chomping at the bit to get that back from us, and we want to make sure we get another win.</seg>
<seg id="8">Before we even came in here, you knew this was going to be a big one.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now we are here, it's time to perform, really.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wales have only claimed one victory against Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in World Cup history - and that was 32 years ago in a third-place play-off when they toppled the Wallabies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And their overall record under head coach Warren Gatland shows just seven wins from 41 attempts at the hands of the three southern hemisphere heavyweights.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wales halted a 13-Test losing sequence at Australia's hands last November, with Tipuric set to be among several survivors from that 9-6 success who run out at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Asked if there had been a mental block prior to that win, Tipuric added: "It's tough to say.</seg>
<seg id="14">Those games are so tight, there is maybe... people would expect there was a bit of a mental block, I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the end in the last game we probably left about 15 points out there, so it made the scoreline look a lot closer than it actually was."</seg>
<seg id="16">If Wales are to triumph, then Tipuric's battle at the breakdown with Australia's revered back-row double act Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be crucial.</seg>
<seg id="17">The 67 times-capped Tipuric has encountered both players on several previous occasions, and he knows exactly what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="18">"They are absolutely world-class sevens," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">When you play against world-class back-rowers you always know you are going to be in for a tough game.</seg>
<seg id="20">Those two are consistently up there with the best in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">You know what type of game you are going to be in for.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pocock is one of the best players in the world over the ball defensively - and Michael is more of an attacking seven and probably has a bit more of a rugby brain to be in the right place at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="23">You would rather play the best players in the world and challenge yourself, rather than face a back-row that isn't as good.</seg>
<seg id="24">You want to play against the best, and you know against those two you will have to be on form.</seg>
<seg id="25">I wouldn't say that Sunday is so much a cup final, but it's an important game for us in this World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="26">Momentum is an important part of it.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you keep on building and putting in good performances, you are going to be flying and tough to beat.</seg>

<seg id="2">Meeting of the government subcommittee at Minato Ward, Tokyo on the afternoon of the 27th, discussing how to dispose of the treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant</seg>
<seg id="3">TEPCO representatives met at a government subcommittee on the 27th to discuss what to do with the ever increasing amount of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, presenting the equipment and specific procedure deemed necessary in the cases of releasing it into the ocean and evaporation into the atmosphere, both of which have been proven as disposal methods both in Japan and overseas.</seg>
<seg id="4">To reign in and curb any misinformation, due to radioactive materials such as tritium being present in the water, TEPCO says they will check the concentration, and if any abnormality is detected before release, they would perform an emergency shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="5">Regarding the procedures proposed in the meeting, committee members said they would like clarification on how much time it will take, and pointed out that the significance of releasing into the ocean would change depending on whether Fukushima's fishing industry was still in an unrecovered state, or if it was done once it had been restored somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it was said that TEPCO also needs to consider the timeline of society.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is it true that if Yoshimoto Kogyo takes “90% of guarantee”, it would be considered as gifts from Entertainers?</seg>
<seg id="2">In a series of problems at Yoshimoto Kogyo, triggered by shady business with anti-social forces, the problems surrounding guarantees are also attracting attention.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a press conference on July 22nd, president Okamoto Akihiko said, "there is no such thing as the company getting 90% and entertainers getting 10%", and states that on average is “5:5 or 6:4", but entertainers are rallying against that.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are opinions by investors on Twitter that if Yoshimoto take 90% on the “9:1” ratio, then it will be considered to be a gift from the entertainers to Yoshimoto which is taxable, and this has been re-tweeted over 30,000 times.</seg>
<seg id="5">If the share of guarantee is "9:1", will there be a gift tax?</seg>
<seg id="6">We have asked certified tax accountant, Yuki Ando.</seg>
<seg id="7">●Corporations are not subjected to gift tax in the first place</seg>
<seg id="8">Putting aside the issue of distribution rate of the guarantee, I will answer this from a tax accountant's perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yoshimoto Kogyo is a corporation and not an individual, and they are not subject to gift tax in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="10">Say for example the distribution of a 1 million yen job is "9:1"; Yoshimoto Kogyo's revenue will be 1 million yen, expense would be 100 thousand yen and profit will be 900 thousand yen.</seg>
<seg id="11">That would be subject to corporate tax.</seg>
<seg id="12">I am sure they filed like so and have paid their corporate tax.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also, it’s not like the entertainers are saying what they actually received is not what they should be receiving, even if they have doubt regarding distribution rate.</seg>
<seg id="14">And I think they are filing taxes depending on how much they have actually received.</seg>
<seg id="15">Gift is about both parties acting on the understanding of “giving and receiving XX amount”, hence if the giver (entertainer) does not recognize that, it would not become a gift even if the counterpart was an individual.</seg>
<seg id="16">If you trade something that clearly has a price (e.g. buying or selling real estate) at a price that is far from the original market price to avoid paying taxes, there would be a problem with calculating tax.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, for cases such as this, where both parties have been transacting without any conflict, it will be hard for a third party to decide what the appropriate price is from a taxation point of view.</seg>
<seg id="18">I personally feel sorry for the 1yen payment record, though.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Total panic' as White House struggles to find impeachment footing</seg>
<seg id="2">White House officials were scrambling to figure out how to counter the renewed Democratic impeachment push Thursday, with one source familiar with the situation describing a sense of "total panic" over the past week at the lack of a plan to address the new reality.</seg>
<seg id="3">There appears to be rising "anxiety, unease, and concern" - as one person close to the White House described the mood in the West Wing - that the whistleblower's allegations could seriously wound the president and some of those around him.</seg>
<seg id="4">"There's not a lot of confidence that there's no there there," this person said.</seg>
<seg id="5">White House officials remained unsure of how to proceed, not only because is there no apparent plan for the situation, but because the allegations are so serious that the usual methods the president has used to successfully escape past controversies may not apply: "This doesn't look like something that's going to be overtaken by the next news cycle," the person quipped.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another person familiar with the discussions described the mood inside the White House as "shell-shocked," with increasing wariness that as this impeachment inquiry drags out, the likelihood increases that the president could respond erratically and become "unmanageable."</seg>
<seg id="7">That concern was echoed by another source, who said some around the president anticipate he will engage in more "impulsive" behavior, with pressure expected to build on him daily during the impeachment inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's sparking worries that Trump could display increasingly unpredictable behavior and lash out in unexpected ways - both a presidential and a political concern in an election year environment.</seg>
<seg id="9">With his presidency facing what may be its biggest threat yet, Trump has cycled from offense to defense, reviving a strategy that he viewed as effective during Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">He tried to downplay his request for the Ukrainian president to help investigate his political rivals, to divert attention to actions by Democrats and presidential contender Joe Biden, and to discredit the whistleblower as having partisan motives.</seg>
<seg id="11">But while many in the White House are battle-tested from the Mueller investigation, this time is starting to feel different, aides and advisers said.</seg>
<seg id="12">For a president whose brand is viewed as strength, Wednesday's press conference made him look defeated, said one person familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">While Trump relished questions on the Russia investigation, he seemed to be in no mood to answer questions about Ukraine, they said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some allies of the president believe the damage could be mitigated, with some seizing on the fact that the whistleblower did not have first-hand knowledge of the controversial call in question between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy - a fact which they argue damages his or her credibility.</seg>
<seg id="15">And, as often happens, when the president is under siege, that fact energizes his core supporters in his defense.</seg>
<seg id="16">But one Republican strategist close to the White House points out that the president's base approval ratings are already sky-high - and impeachment will do little to win over new supporters.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There is no upside to having the next four months focused on the president's impeachment," particularly if it stymies his legislative agenda and dominates the news cycle.</seg>
<seg id="18">Another of the sources said that those who were arguing impeachment could help the president weren't fully grasping how much of a wild card his response could be.</seg>
<seg id="19">Worried White House officials have been reaching out to advisers for help in assembling an impeachment response team.</seg>
<seg id="20">With the effort still in the early phases, it remained unclear whether any type of war room-style effort would come to fruition or what form it might take, according to a person briefed on the plans.</seg>
<seg id="21">But there was an acknowledgement that a coordinated legal and communications strategy was needed, with a clear leader able to marshal a public relations offensive to counter the release of the scathing whistleblower report and the momentum its release has given Democratic impeachment efforts, that person said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The lack of a long-term strategic vision has been starkly visible, as when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin indicated they were not going to release the memo describing Trump's call with the Ukrainian president - and then 48 hours later, feeling there was no choice but to release the document, according the source familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is anticipated there will be more pressure now than during the investigation by Robert Mueller, who was mostly silent, speaking only through his indictments. One person who may become involved in developing an impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, Trump's outside pit bull and former campaign manager, said the person involved in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Lewandowski told NBC News it was not accurate to suggest he would lead such an effort.</seg>
<seg id="25">"For the last five years, I've done everything I can to support the president and his agenda," he said, "but I have had no discussions with president and his team at all about joining a team to push back on this fake impeachment narrative."</seg>
<seg id="26">Trump's outside lawyer from the Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also remaining involved in the impeachment efforts.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We will deal with matters as appropriate," Sekulow said when reached by NBC News for comment.</seg>
<seg id="28">The White House currently lacks a lawyer experienced in impeachment now that Emmet Flood, who worked on the Clinton impeachment and guided the White House through the end of the Mueller investigation, has left, with current White House counsel Pat Cipollone lacking that type of experience.</seg>
<seg id="29">One source familiar with the White House strategy said that overall, officials were nowhere near the point of bringing people on board or setting up war rooms - but acknowledge they need a coordinated, all hands-on-deck response effort and someone who can lead a political fight, the person said.</seg>

<seg id="5">The program was the milestone 100th morning drama.</seg>
<seg id="6">Orphaned in the Pacific War and taken in by the Shibatas, a family of dairy farmers in Hokkaido, this depicts the heroine, Okuhara Natsu (Hirose) growing up and bursting into the world of anime in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="2">Published 9/6 (Fri) 13:51</seg>
<seg id="3">Finally got a boyfriend, but because of his work we are in a long distance relationship.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said "Let's get married someday" but I can't see that goal and feel gloomy.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can I make the best of the situation and lead this to nuptial?</seg>
<seg id="6">Nikkei doors editor asked professor Morikawa Tomoyoshi, lecturer on "romance studies" at Waseda University, for solutions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is a must-read as Morikawa professor's advice comes from exhaustive data analysis.</seg>
<seg id="8">Today's problem</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm wondering if I should continue my relationship with my long distance boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would like to continue living in Kansai where my parents' house and my job are, but he works in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="11">He works for a trading company, so there is a possibility of him being assigned abroad in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">He says, "let's get married someday", but I cannot see the goal.</seg>
<seg id="13">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="14">23 years old, manufacturing company, office worker</seg>
<seg id="15">●Long distance couples who end up marrying are only a minority</seg>
<seg id="16">Nikkei doors editing section (hereon "--") : Ms. C has been dating her boyfriend for 1.5 years and they are in a long distance relationship.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is a saying "distance makes the two of us strong", but does a long distance relationship really work?</seg>
<seg id="18">Professor. Morikawa Tomoyoshi (hereon "Morikawa"): When it comes to long distance relationships, a survey that was conducted by DeNA Travel (August 2017, 1147 people replied) is famous, and according to that data, only 16% of couples in long distance relationships ended up marrying.</seg>
<seg id="19">Love is something that uses five senses, looking at (sight), listening to (hearing), holding hands (touch), inhaling scent (smell) and kissing (taste) are fundamentally what allows for deeper relationship.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, in case of long distance relationships, it's mostly just hearing a partner's voice over the phone.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is a possibility that continuing the relationship by hearing only is too difficult.</seg>
<seg id="22">Also, there is the issue of cost.</seg>
<seg id="23">When visiting a partner’s house, transportation cost and travel time are burdensome and take effort; when it should be a day off to refresh oneself, one ends up being exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="24">You would feel lonely when you are heading home.</seg>
<seg id="25">-- : So if it looks like it's going to be a long distance relationship, the only way is to break-up?</seg>
<seg id="26">Morikawa: For couples who can tolerate not seeing each other often, and for those whose separation time is predetermined, it will work out.</seg>
<seg id="27">For example, getting engaged after a year or being transferred back after 2 years.</seg>
<seg id="28">In situations where you can't see where you are in the future, it may be difficult.</seg>

<seg id="3">And in his defense of the president on Thursday, he accused Democrats of trying to obtain nude pictures of the president.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, made the accusation during his opening statement at the hearing about the whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump sought Ukrainian help in investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.</seg>
<seg id="5">The congressman called the Ukraine scandal a "grotesque spectacle" created by the left and their "media assets" before claiming the Democrats wanted to see photos of the president in the buff:</seg>
<seg id="6">"Democrats on this very committee negotiated with people who they thought were Ukrainians in order to obtain nude pictures of Trump," Nunes said.</seg>
<seg id="7">People can reasonably ask why the Democrats are so determined to impeach this president when in just a year, they will have a chance.</seg>
<seg id="8">After Nunes finished his dressing-down, HuffPost senior political reporter Jennifer Bendery decided to find out if Democratic politicians are trying to get to the, um, bottom of this.</seg>
<seg id="9">So far, only Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes (D) has responded, but we suspect his answer is the naked truth for many of his colleagues as well.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mediaite.com suspects Nunes' clothing-optional comments were a reference to "some of the more salacious and unconfirmed details" that supposedly appear in the controversial Steele Dossier.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's the infamous collection of explosive allegations against Trump compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele that mentions the possible existence of a "pee tape," which allegedly shows him watching sex workers engage in "golden showers" in a Moscow hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="1">Potential renewable biofuel research could help lower emissions</seg>
<seg id="2">While electric cars and Tesla semi-trucks have dominated the headlines in recent years, one thing flies seemingly out of the reach of renewable energy: airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="3">But a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that could allow renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta in the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences who began this project in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="5">His lab is developing hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes like restaurant grease, animal renderings, and canola oil.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower quality oils in its production, allowing it to not only release an estimated 85 per cent less carbon emissions than petroleum-based fuels, but also utilizing wastes from other industries in the process.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technology works to mimic the hydrocarbons present in petroleum-based fuels.</seg>
<seg id="8">"What our technology did in the first generation," Bressler said. "is [actually make] the hydrocarbons which are the exact molecules in diesel gasoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">While this presents a new option for biofuel use, previously produced biofuel technologies tend to de-stabilize at lower temperatures, which, for an aircraft travelling at high altitudes, poses a serious problem.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The problem with jet fuel is it's a bit of a catch-22," Bressler said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's actually worth less than diesel but it has higher requirements.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bressler's lab is currently looking at two options for producing jet biofuel.</seg>
<seg id="13">The first being a low-risk approach which requires giving their hydrocarbon biofuel another treatment and adding in hydrogen.</seg>
<seg id="14">The second option is to continue work on already partially developed chemistry which would keep the fuel stable, even at lower temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We can actually play some games with the chemistry in our reactor to try to change the chemistry a little bit," Bressler said about the second option.</seg>
<seg id="16">That one's a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="17">The University of Alberta spin-off company Forge Hydrocarbons is working on commercializing the product as airlines and both the Canadian and American militaries are increasingly investing in the renewable option.</seg>
<seg id="18">"They can see [a] future where one day somebody might turn around and charge them a carbon tax," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want an alternative in place that is a fallback position.</seg>
<seg id="20">Currently, Forge runs a pilot plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Centre and recently acquired a US$4 million investment from Lockheed Martin to support the construction of a $25-million production facility to be located in Sombra, Ontario.</seg>
<seg id="21">The facility is expected to produce around 19 million litres of biofuel each year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bressler also notes while estimates for carbon reductions are around 85 per cent, aspects such as how the fuel is transported and produced are reasons for why carbon reductions aren't higher.</seg>
<seg id="23">"As a technology guy," Bressler said.</seg>
<seg id="24">My job is to create options so there can be an informed decision and multiple choices on which to go with.</seg>

<seg id="2">A senior cabinet minister last night said the country risked a "violent, popular uprising" if a second referendum overturned the original result.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Prime Minister's senior allies warned the UK faces civil unrest on the scale of the yellow vest protests in France over economic inequalities and Los Angeles riots in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Johnson said "tempers need to come down" in the furious row over political language - but insisted he won't stop using the word "surrender."</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite his appeal for calm, a cabinet minister told The Times: "In this country we never had the gilets jaunes [yellow vests] or the LA riots [in 1992].</seg>
<seg id="6">People don't think it's possible in this country just because it has not happened before.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now they have a model - gilets jaunes - they have encrypted phones to co-ordinate it, and it only takes a couple of nasty populist frontmen to inspire people.</seg>
<seg id="8">Riots in erupted in Los Angeles after a jury acquitted four white police officers for beating up a black taxi driver Rodney King in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this year, anti-government French protesters wearing yellow high visibility vests - gilet jaunes have been wrought havoc and destruction on the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister pointed to Mr Johnson's warning in the Commons that there would be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system" if Britain failed to leave the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If we have a referendum with 30 million people who vote, and we vote Remain by 66 per cent, that's ten million people who are unhappy," said the minister.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if 99 per cent of them shrug it off, that's still 100,000 really angry people who will write to their MP and not let it go.</seg>
<seg id="13">It doesn't take much and soon you have tens of thousands of people on the street.</seg>
<seg id="14">A senior cabinet minister added that country risked a "violent, popular uprising" if a second referendum overturned the result of the first one.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Johnson has called for there to be a general election to allow voters to settle Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has been reported he is facing a Cabinet revolt to lower his Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with the EU instead.</seg>

<seg id="2">India's monsoon season has overrun by almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collapsing buildings and many crops beginning to rot.</seg>
<seg id="3">Normally the monsoon in north India recedes by the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month has been 37% above normal.</seg>
<seg id="4">If the situation continues for the remaining few days, it will be the latest the monsoon has ever receded in decades, according to experts in the India Meteorological Department.</seg>
<seg id="5">Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain, the latest being the town of Pune in western India, where torrential rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and havoc from collapsed buildings.</seg>

<seg id="1">Heavy exposure to pesticides may boost risk of heart disease, stroke</seg>
<seg id="2">Working around high levels of pesticides may translate into a high risk for heart trouble later, a new study suggests.</seg>
<seg id="3">That was the case for a group of Japanese-American men in Hawaii who were followed for more than three decades.</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to men who had not worked around pesticides, those who had the greatest exposure had a 45 percent higher risk for heart disease or stroke, researchers found.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This study emphasizes the importance of using personal protective equipment during exposure to pesticides on the job and the importance of documenting occupational exposure to pesticides in medical records, as well as controlling standard heart disease risk factors," said study co-author Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.</seg>
<seg id="6">She's a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.</seg>
<seg id="7">The findings stem from data on more than 6,000 men on Oahu who took part in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because only men of Japanese descent were involved, the findings may not apply to women or other populations, the researchers noted.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since pesticides have a long half-life, their effects on health may show up years after exposure.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this case, the greatest effects were seen within 10 years of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="11">"After following the men for 34 years, the link between being exposed to pesticides at work and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant," Rodriguez said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was probably because other factors tied to aging became more important, masking the possible relation of pesticides and cardiovascular disease later in life.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Zelensky-Trump phone call: Poroshenko weighs in</seg>
<seg id="2">It was an explosive week in Washington politics, with impeachment proceedings launched against US President Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">For political novice Volodymyr Zelensky, being swept up into a political scandal is a move he would have wanted to avoid.</seg>
<seg id="4">But what do we know so far about the Zelensky-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching effects for the former?</seg>
<seg id="5">Quite early on in the phone call, Trump tells Zelensky that the US is doing more for Ukraine than other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although the calls notes released by the White House is not verbatim, it details Trump taking a hit at German Chancellor Angela Merkel - that the German leader and other European counterparts engage in talks rather than concrete proposals.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was Zelensky's response that has been seen as controversial, saying that he does not agree with Trump 100%, rather 1000%.</seg>
<seg id="8">Zelensky added that both the French President Macron and Merkel are not working enough to assist Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="9">This exchange had politicians, particularly from the opposition within Ukraine, talking on social media.</seg>
<seg id="10">Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine's former president, took to Twitter to say that the support provided by the EU "has been unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="11">In other tweets, Poroshenko said that he was grateful for the EU support provided during "Russian aggression," which included sanctions and economic aid.</seg>
<seg id="12">Others expressed their concern, with Ukranian politician Victoria Voytsiska saying: "How could we speak to Germany and France again?"</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump goes on to allude to military aid and asks Zelensky to investigate not one, but two claims: one into Joe Biden's son Hunter but also into the hacked DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine had some involvement in hacking into the Democrat's emails during the 2016 election.</seg>
<seg id="14">Whether this will hinder European relations, or burn bridges with his French and German counterparts, is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="15">I don't want to say anything bad about anyone ...</seg>
<seg id="16">"We thank everyone who helps us," Zelensky said in New York at the UN General Assembly following the release of the phone transcript.</seg>
<seg id="17">Zelensky is set to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany, and France in the upcoming Normandy Four summit in October.</seg>

<seg id="2">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Acting Administrator Peter Gaynor smiles as he testifies before a Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on FEMA's FY2020 budget request on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 3, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="3">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the White House said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gaynor, FEMA's deputy administrator, had been acting chief of the agency, which oversees the government response to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.</seg>
<seg id="5">The agency has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since March, when Brock Long left the post.</seg>
<seg id="6">Long resigned after the Department of Homeland Security, under which FEMA falls, concluded Long had inappropriately used government vehicles to commute between Washington and his home in North Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="7">A different nominee for the job, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month, after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a barroom brawl.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gaynor's nomination to the post was expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job.</seg>
<seg id="10">Before becoming FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, Gaynor worked in emergency management in Rhode Island and was a Marine, the White House said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police Shut Down Illegal Marijuana Vaping Operating In San Gabriel Valley - CBS Los Angeles</seg>
<seg id="2">EL MONTE (CBSLA) - Police shut down an illegal marijuana vaping operation in the San Gabriel Valley Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bust happened at about 4:37 p.m. after police conducting a warrant search for suspected illegal marijuana vape pen sales and found large jars of butane honey oil - concentrated cannabis oil - at an office building in the 9600 block of Telstar Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lt. Christopher Cano with the El Monte Police said officers also found a machine that was used to load vape cartridges.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The process is very dangerous," Cano said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cano, who used to work narcotics, said the process of distilling the oil for use in vape products is potentially flammable.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Simple static electricity from our clothes can ignite these fumes causing not just a fire, but an explosion because it's under concentration," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">And if there's multiple jars and things like that, we're going to have one explosion after the next causing not just a fire, but we could possibly have a full complex taken out with the explosion.</seg>
<seg id="9">A hazmat team was called to the vacant office to take possession of the illegal and potentially dangerous substance.</seg>
<seg id="10">The value of the confiscated products and equipment was not immediately known.</seg>
<seg id="11">Detectives said they received an anonymous tip that led to the search warrant where they discovered the illegal operation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Investigators are still trying to figure out who's behind the illegal vaping operation.</seg>
<seg id="13">They said they believe the person responsible set up shop in the office because the space was vacant.</seg>
<seg id="14">While the investigation continues, officers said they wanted to make sure the illegal vaping products did not make it to the street, especially in the wake of recent headlines involving the dangers of vaping.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is just stuff that they don't even know if they're truly getting what they think that they're buying," Cano said.</seg>
<seg id="16">This could be mixed with other harmful chemicals.</seg>
<seg id="17">It could be very harmful to our community, to our children, so we always caution them that they should stay away from these operations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Elizabeth I's lost dress to go on display at Hampton Court Palace</seg>
<seg id="2">It was made of the finest chamblet silk, woven with strips of beaten silver, and had been exquisitely embroidered in a rich pattern of plants, beasts and butterflies.</seg>
<seg id="3">To Eleri Lynn, curator of the dress collection at Historic Royal Palaces, that meant only one thing.</seg>
<seg id="4">The faded piece of fabric she was looking at, hanging on the wall of a tiny rural parish church where it had been placed 100 years earlier, could only be a lost piece of clothing from the wardrobe of Elizabeth I.</seg>
<seg id="5">Three years after Lynn stumbled across the sumptuous fabric, which had been used as an altar cloth in the church in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress is to go on display next month at Hampton Court palace, close to the very rooms where the Tudor queen may well have worn it more than 450 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a measure of the importance of the discovery that in the entire royal dress collection, only one other item of 16th-century dress survives.</seg>
<seg id="7">And while there is no cast iron proof that the dress was once worn by Elizabeth, three years of scholarship have only strengthened experts' conviction that the dress must have been part of the royal wardrobe.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Cloth of silver," a fantastically expensive fabric, was by law reserved only for the most senior members of the royal household, while the "virtuoso" quality of the embroidered plants and flowers, later supplemented by stags and dogs, butterflies, fishermen and a bear, also points to the loftiest of previous owners.</seg>
<seg id="9">The gown, at the time it was made, would have cost the equivalent of a Tudor mansion.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition, said Lynn, in the 1590s, late in Elizabeth's reign, she had grown threatened by other women at court and would not have tolerated rivals wearing such exquisite fabric.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's a big thing to say, so I have had lots of peer reviewers come and have a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="12">And it has always been really gratifying that when they see it they have a "wow" moment too, and leave quite convinced that we are looking at an item of royal dress."</seg>
<seg id="13">The long second life of the dress panel, recut to serve as an altar cloth in the obscure church of St Faith's, Bacton, is not quite so unexpected as it might appear.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bacton was the home hamlet of Blanche Parry, the closest of Elizabeth's maids of honour who served the queen throughout her long life, and local legend has long associated the textile with Parry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Though the dress postdates her death in 1590, experts believe Elizabeth must have given it to the Parry family or the parish in Blanche's memory, before her own death in 1603.</seg>
<seg id="16">After more than 1,000 hours of conservation, 400 of them spent in the most delicate handstitching using specially dyed silk and fine surgical needles, the altar cloth will go on display next to the "Rainbow portrait," one of the most celebrated contemporary paintings of Elizabeth, which shows her dressed in a similar gown and which has been loaned by Hatfield House for the duration of the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="17">"When you're working with historic textiles you gain a real respect for the craftsmanship of the people who made them," said Libby Thompson, who led the conservation, much of which took place in a converted greenhouse in the Hampton Court grounds - the only space large enough to house some of the palace's priceless tapestries.</seg>
<seg id="18">Looking at the embroidery, on the front and the back, it's given me a massive respect for those who made it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I have never worked on anything that's quite so elite.</seg>

<seg id="2">In a trial where voters are seeking invalidation of the election to the House of Councilors that was carried out in July, claiming it was a violation of the Constitution without correcting the disparity of one vote, the first oral proceedings took place at the Miyazaki Branch of the Fukuoka High Court, and the trial was concluded the same day.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the complaint, the plaintiffs point out that compared to Fukui, where there is the least number of voters per member of Upper House in the election this July, the value of one vote in Miyazaki is 0.71, and only 0.48 in Kagoshima, and due to this the election is invalid.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the first oral proceedings held on the 27th at the Miyazaki Branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff asserted that “the value of one vote per person was unequal and unconstitutional”</seg>
<seg id="5">The defendant, the Prefectural Election Commission, stated It was “not a significant enough inequality to be considered unfair, so it should be considered constitutional." And requested the claim to be dismissed.</seg>

<seg id="10">El Mencho's Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least a third of the drugs entering the U.S. by land and sea.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the Department of Justice, the cartel has trafficked "tons" of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl-laced heroin.</seg>
<seg id="12">El Mencho has a $10 million bounty on his head.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ironically, he lived in California some 30 years ago, where he was arrested on drug charges and eventually deported back to Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's where he started the violent cartel.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has got an enormous amount of weapons, RPGs, 50 caliber weapons.</seg>
<seg id="16">He basically has his own SWAT teams," Donahue said.</seg>
<seg id="17">From shooting down a Mexican Army helicopter, killing six, to being implicated in a public hanging this summer, El Mencho protects his empire with impunity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cartel violence has led to thousands of murders in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to statistics from the Mexican government, there are approximately 94 homicides per day.</seg>
<seg id="20">Back in Chicago, the Mexican drugs seized are so toxic, they can't be handled without protective gear.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the lab, packs of cocaine are stamped with trafficker brands.</seg>
<seg id="22">More than a third can be traced back to El Mencho's cartel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He is the one that is responsible for sending the poison that is actually killing innocent women and kids," Donahue said.</seg>
<seg id="24">So, when someone's child dies, Donahue said there's "a good chance" those drugs came from El Mencho's organization.</seg>
<seg id="25">Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died from an overdose.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sony has shed more light on upcoming PS4 exclusive The Last of Us: Part Two.</seg>
<seg id="3">As part of Sony's recent State of Play presentation, Sony announced a February 2020 release date for the Last of Us sequel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fans were also treated to some breathtaking new gameplay footage of the upcoming action game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even more details have been announced in the days since the big Last of Us 2 gameplay reveal.</seg>
<seg id="6">And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are taking it back to the old-school in more ways than one.</seg>
<seg id="7">Something we haven't seen very often since the PSOne era, The Last of Us: Part 2 will ship on multiple discs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann confirmed as much in an excellent interview with The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel evolved into one of the biggest games ever.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This story is ambitious and complex in ways that the first one wasn't," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">And it needed to be that big to tell this kind of story with this many characters.</seg>
<seg id="11">We didn't set out to make the biggest game ever, it just kind of evolved that way.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We got excited by how much this story has to offer, and there's going to be moments where you'll think you're getting to the end and you'll realise it was just the opening part and it's opened up to this whole other section," Druckmann continues.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's so ambitious the game doesn't fit on one BluRay, it's on two discs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Elsewhere, it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two not safe for work Easter eggs (via Gamespot).</seg>
<seg id="15">While we won't ruin the surprise here, the in-game Easter eggs include references to old-school Naughty Dog releases.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can find out more when The Last of Us: Part Two launches exclusively for PS4 on February 21, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="17">PS4 owners can prepare for the release of the sequel by picking up The Last of Us Remastered with PS Plus.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 games for October 2019, which includes the aforementioned Naughty Dog release.</seg>
<seg id="19">MLB The Show 19 will also be available for PS Plus subscribers in October.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you enjoy The Last of Us Remastered and want to pre-order the sequel, Sony has announced multiple editions of the game, including a bumper version containing a replica of Ellie's backpack, her bracelet and a 12-inch statue of the iconic character.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the 26th, on Nanao city's island of Noto-jima, where the population is ageing and the number of shops is on the decline, the Noto-jima Community Development Council that is made up of residents began trial of mobile sales.</seg>
<seg id="3">The trial will continue until December, and on the first day station wagons loaded with daily necessities, condiments and seasonings and other food products visited Suso Town Council and Hannoura Town Council.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some products sold a lot more quickly than expected and had to be quickly replenished, while residents said it was "a big help", "picking out products was fun" and they hoped the service would continue.</seg>
<seg id="5">The station wagons were loaded with 110 products, including prepared side dishes, city designated rubbish bags and detergent.</seg>
<seg id="6">To make it easier for elderly people living alone to eat, side dishes such as potato salad and fried strips of burdock were available in smaller packs at the reasonable price of 100 yen.</seg>
<seg id="7">At Suso Town Council, residents queued up to purchase items, and the salt and sugar sold out.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kikuchi Akinobu of the development council expressed their surprise, saying, "I didn't think things would sell as well as they did."</seg>
<seg id="9">Harada Mitsue (83) of Suso-cho, who would usually be driven to the shops by her husband, said, "The prices are cheap and it's convenient. I don't know how much longer my husband will be able to drive for, so I'd definitely like this service to continue."</seg>
<seg id="10">Other shoppers had particular requests, one asking for them to bring drip coffee rather than canned coffee.</seg>
<seg id="11">The council will consider a selection of products that suits everyone's needs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Noto-jima currently only has one convenience store where you buy daily necessities, so the development council has set up the mobile sales trial to help people who find it difficult to go out shopping.</seg>
<seg id="13">The service will visit the island's 20 town councils once a month until December, after which, they will consider whether it can continue as a normal service in the new year.</seg>

<seg id="4">Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old environmental activist from Sweden, addressed the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, calling for stronger measures.</seg>
<seg id="5">By boycotting classes and sitting in front of parliament, she has helped to spark "school strikes" around the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Anxious and frustrated young people took part in protests en masse around the world, including in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is estimated that around 4 million people participated in more than 150 countries.</seg>

<seg id="9">The threat of climate change draws ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Paris Agreement, which will come fully into effect in 2020, is an international framework that aims to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases to essentially zero by the latter half of the century, and to keep temperature rise since the Industrial Revolution within 2属C, preferably 1.5属C.</seg>
<seg id="11">All participating nations will do their part to implement the necessary measures regardless of whether they are a developed or developing nation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yet, abnormal weather patterns that have been linked to global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rain, continue to affect various areas.</seg>
<seg id="13">Further efforts are required to combat the rapid pace of global warming.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the summit, which was called into session by UN Secretary-General Guterres to emphasize the impending crisis, 77 nations announced long-term targets to cut emissions to zero by 2050.</seg>
<seg id="15">A further 70 nations have increased their immediate targets.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, the US, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, as well as China and India, have not set any new targets, highlighting the slowness of action on the part of major polluters.</seg>
<seg id="17">Criticism towards Japan for sticking to coal-fired power generation is also persistent.</seg>
<seg id="18">The government's long-term strategy does set forth the intention to reach zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of the century, but this falls far short of the countries aiming to get to zero by 2050.</seg>

<seg id="1">Quantum internet closer to reality -- ScienceDaily</seg>
<seg id="2">A U.S. Army research result brings the quantum internet a step closer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such an internet could offer the military security, sensing and timekeeping capabilities not possible with traditional networking approaches.</seg>
<seg id="4">The U.S. Army's Combat Capability Development's Army Research Laboratory's Center for Distributed Quantum Information, funded and managed by the lab's Army Research Office, saw researchers at the University of Innsbruck achieve a record for the transfer of quantum entanglement between matter and light -- a distance of 50 kilometers using fiber optic cables.</seg>
<seg id="5">Entanglement is a correlation that can be created between quantum entities such as qubits.</seg>
<seg id="6">When two qubits are entangled and a measurement is made on one, it will affect the outcome of a measurement made on the other, even if that second qubit is physically far away.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This [50 kilometers] is two orders of magnitude further than was previously possible and is a practical distance to start building inter-city quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physicist at University of Innsbruck and the principal investigator for the project, whose findings are published in the Nature journal Quantum Information.</seg>
<seg id="8">Intercity quantum networks would be composed of distant network nodes of physical qubits, which are, despite the large physical separation, nevertheless entangled.</seg>
<seg id="9">This distribution of entanglement is essential for establishing a quantum internet, researchers said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The demonstration is a major step forward for achieving large scale distributed entanglement," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-manager of the Army program supporting the research.</seg>
<seg id="11">The quality of the entanglement after traveling through fiber is also high enough at the other end to meet some of the requirements for some of the most difficult quantum networking applications.</seg>
<seg id="12">The research team started the experiment with a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.</seg>
<seg id="13">Using laser beams, the researchers wrote a quantum state onto the ion and simultaneously excited it to emit a photon in which quantum information is stored.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the light particle were entangled.</seg>
<seg id="15">The challenge is to transmit the photon over fiber optic cables.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The photon emitted by the calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the optical fiber," Lanyon said.</seg>
<seg id="17">His team therefore initially sent the light particle through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser.</seg>
<seg id="18">The photon wavelength was converted to the optimal value for long-distance travel -- the current telecommunications standard wavelength of 1,550 nanometers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The researchers then sent this photon through the 50-kilometer-long optical fiber line.</seg>
<seg id="20">Their measurements show that atom and light particles were still entangled even after the wavelength conversion and the distance traveled.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The choice to use calcium means these results also provide a direct path to realizing an entangled network of atomic clocks over a large physical distance, since calcium can be co-trapped with a high quality "clock" qubit.</seg>
<seg id="22">Large scale entangled clock networks are of great interest to the Army for precision position, navigation, and timing applications," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, an Army researcher who also co-manages the program.</seg>
