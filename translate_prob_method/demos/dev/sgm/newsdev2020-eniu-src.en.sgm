<seg id="86">Speaker (Hon. George Qulaut) (interpretation): Can you say the opening prayer, please, Mr. Shooyook.</seg>
<seg id="87">Speaker (interpretation): Good afternoon, my fellow Nunavummiut. Members, ministers, and (interpretation ends) Premier, (interpretation) welcome to the House.</seg>
<seg id="88">Ministers’ Statements. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Mr. Johnny Mike.  Item 2: Ministers’ Statements</seg>
<seg id="89">Minister’s Statement 285 – 4(3): New Power Plant for Qikiqtarjuaq (Mike)</seg>
<seg id="90">Good afternoon, Nunavummiut and residents of my community.</seg>
<seg id="91">Mr. Speaker, this past September the Qulliq Energy Corporation completed the construction and testing of a new power plant in the community of Taloyoak.</seg>
<seg id="92">I am pleased to rise today to announce that the energy corporation is continuing to take strides toward their long-term plan to rebuild and modernize Nunavut’s aging infrastructure with the completion of the corporation’s newest power plant in Qikiqtarjuaq.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new power plant has been in full operation since December 2016 and replaced one of the oldest power plants in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="94">(interpretation ends) A reliable supply of electricity is critical to all Nunavummiut. Qikiqtarjuaq’s new plant will ensure that the community will have a source of power they can rely on for decades to come.</seg>
<seg id="95">(interpretation) The new plant’s environmental benefits include a reduction in carbon emissions and less sound pollution due to the installation of four new fuel-efficient generator sets as well as a hospital grade silencer.</seg>
<seg id="96">In addition, the plant’s new design can accommodate community expansion and already allows for the integration of renewable energy systems, such as solar and wind energy systems.</seg>
<seg id="97">Mr. Speaker, the energy corporation is committed to supplying Nunavummiut with dependable and affordable energy while actively seeking opportunities to move our territory towards a clean and sustainable energy future.</seg>
<seg id="98">Our priority is to rebuild our infrastructure to provide more reliable power while also opening new doors that allow for renewable energy systems to be developed in Nunavut today.</seg>
<seg id="99">On behalf of the energy corporation, I would like to extend my gratitude to the residents of Qikiqtarjuaq for their support throughout the construction of the community’s new power plant.</seg>
<seg id="100">I look forward to celebrating the new power plant with residents and officials of Qikiqtarjuaq with a grand opening and community feast in late March.</seg>
<seg id="101">Minister of Justice, Mr. Keith Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="102">Minister’s Statement 286 – 4(3): CBC’s “Keeping Canada Safe” Documentary (Peterson)</seg>
<seg id="103">Hon. Keith Peterson: Mr. Speaker, with Canada turning 150 this year, CBC will be launching a “Keeping Canada Safe” documentary series where Canadians are introduced to a day in the life of those who help keep our country safe and secure.</seg>
<seg id="104">The aim of this series is to inspire conversation about what it means to be safe in a world that is rapidly evolving.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September of 2016 the Department of Justice took part in the filming of an episode for this eight-part CBC series. In the Nunavut episode, the film crew went on an overnight trip with the Corrections Division Cultural Skills Program team and three low-risk incarcerated Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="106">The film highlights Nunavut’s unique program that is provided to incarcerated individuals, who are given the opportunity to learn traditional skills and share knowledge on the land, which will assist them with their successful reintegration back into our communities.</seg>
<seg id="107">The Nunavut segment is scheduled to air on April 6, 2017 on CBC at 9:00 p.m. eastern.</seg>
<seg id="108">I encourage my colleagues here in the House and all Nunavummiut to tune in to see some of the good work being done by the Corrections Division and our inmates.</seg>
<seg id="109">Minister of Education, Mr. Paul Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="110">Minister’s Statement 287 – 4(3): Response after Second Reading of Bill 37 (Quassa)</seg>
<seg id="111">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I rise today to respond to a statement that Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated released shortly after the introduction of Bill 37, An Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, this government is taking concrete action on language revitalization and student outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="113">The amendments in Bill 37 ensure the consistent delivery of Inuktitut as the language of instruction, even where there are a limited number of bilingual teachers.</seg>
<seg id="114">Consistency will improve program delivery, resource development, assessments, and teacher training.</seg>
<seg id="115">Mr. Speaker, I have ordered a review of the Nunavut Teacher Education Program that will focus on increasing the number of Inuktut teachers and content teachers.</seg>
<seg id="116">Further, my department and Nunavut Arctic College are designing new programs to increase Inuit employment and to expand the use of Inuktut in our schools.</seg>
<seg id="117">We are collaborating with NTI on an updated Inuit employment plan for educators.</seg>
<seg id="118">Mr. Speaker, we have launched the first ever Inuktut guided reading system. We have already produced over 300 books and teaching guides and we will be providing more books as planned.</seg>
<seg id="119">Some of these books were on display in the foyer on March 2.</seg>
<seg id="120">Mr. Speaker, we have made great progress in developing new curriculum and resources to support language development.</seg>
<seg id="121">Mr. Speaker, taking action to prevent language loss is the responsibility we all share.</seg>
<seg id="122">Efforts must be made at home with parents and the difficult work to standardize Inuktitut must begin now.</seg>
<seg id="123">We must establish a standardized writing system and a standardized vocabulary as building blocks to making Inuktut the first language of schools, government, and businesses in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, fellow members, and citizens of Nunavut, let us all work together to make Inuktut a vehicle for social, cultural and economic revitalization in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="125">Minister of Community and Government Services, Mr. Joe Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="126">Minister’s Statement 288 – 4(3): Fire Prevention Activities (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="127">I rise today to discuss fire prevention activities in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="128">The 2016 annual report from the Office of the Fire Marshal shows that the number of fires in Nunavut has dropped, the dollar loss from fires decreased, and there were no fatalities resulting from fires last year.</seg>
<seg id="129">Since 2004 the Office of the Fire Marshal has provided fire prevention education activities in schools across the territory through the annual Fire Prevention Calendar and the Fire Prevention Colouring Contest.</seg>
<seg id="130">We distributed 4,000 calendars in 2016 which featured photos of our firefighter training courses and students’ drawings. I am very pleased to report that there were 780 pictures submitted from 11 schools in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="131">Each student received a certificate from me and a congratulation letter from the Office of the Fire Marshal.</seg>
<seg id="132">There was a total of $7,000 in prize money distributed to the winning schools.</seg>
<seg id="133">These funds will be used for a student activity programs. Individual gifts were also awarded to students with winning submissions.</seg>
<seg id="134">Today I have the privilege of announcing the winners of the annual colouring contest and they are:</seg>
<seg id="135">From Rankin Inlet, Gianna-Adrielle Hernandez;</seg>
<seg id="136">From Iqaluit, Max Borden;</seg>
<seg id="137">Arviat, Alexia Gibbons and Terrance Arnalak;</seg>

<seg id="145">Minister of Languages, Mr. George Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="146">Minister’s Statement 289 – 4(3): Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit’s Inuktut Language Conference (Kuksuk)</seg>
<seg id="147">Good afternoon, Nunavummiut (interpretation) and my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="148">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce that Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit will be hosting a conference on Inuktut grammar in Cambridge Bay from March 14 to 17, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="149">About 50 language experts and elders from various communities are expected to attend, especially from the Kitikmeot communities.</seg>
<seg id="150">During this conference Taiguusiliuqtiit will consult with participants on the progress towards achieving a unified writing system and future plans for further consultations.</seg>
<seg id="151">Mr. Speaker, my cabinet colleagues and I are looking forward to this important work and future recommendations on a unified writing system for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="152">Minister’s Statement 290 – 4(3): Community Economic Development Meetings (Ell-Kanayuk)</seg>
<seg id="153">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="154">Mr. Speaker, starting in November of 2016 and beginning in the Kitikmeot, the Department of Economic Development and Transportation has been holding economic development meetings with communities.</seg>
<seg id="155">The purpose of these meetings is to learn the type of economic development activities that communities desire and believe are possible, and the kind of investments they hope to attract.</seg>
<seg id="156">The information will contribute to the renewal of the Nunavut Economic Development Strategy, or NEDS.</seg>
<seg id="157">I am pleased to provide my colleagues with an update on the progress of these meetings for the rest of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="158">The North Qikiqtaaluk meetings began on Monday, February 20 and concluded on February 28.</seg>
<seg id="159">The South Qikiqtaaluk region meetings will begin next week, followed by the meetings in the Kivalliq in mid-April.</seg>
<seg id="160">The Kivalliq dates will be confirmed closer to the start of the meetings.</seg>
<seg id="161">Mr. Speaker, in addition to the community meetings, there is also an online economic development survey, which can be submitted anonymously.</seg>
<seg id="162">I look forward to hearing how Nunavut communities wish to move forward in developing our economy.</seg>
<seg id="163">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Mr. Paul Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="164">Minister’s Statement 291 – 4(3): Partnership with Aurora College for Underground Mine Training (Quassa)</seg>
<seg id="165">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I rise in the House today to inform my fellow members of the progress of Sanatuliqsarvik, the Nunavut Mining and Trades Training Centre located in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="166">Nunavut Arctic College has consulted with industry and identified a need to deliver an introduction to underground mining program and an underground mining program.</seg>
<seg id="167">This will benefit Nunavummiut greatly as current careers in underground mining require the training and more careers will be developed in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="168">The college’s first Introduction to Underground Mining Program was successfully delivered in October 2016. This program was sponsored by the Kivalliq Mine Training Society, yet delivered by Nunavut Arctic College at the Sanatuliqsarvik Mining and Trades Training Centre in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="169">There were seven successful students.</seg>
<seg id="170">Our second delivery of the Introduction to Underground Mining Program is currently being delivered in Rankin Inlet, also sponsored by the Kivalliq Mine Training Society.</seg>
<seg id="171">In September of 2016 Nunavut Arctic College did not possess curriculum for the underground mining training program. However, the college has now partnered with Aurora College in the Northwest Territories to obtain the course materials and to offer these courses.</seg>
<seg id="172">Moving forward, the college plans to further adapt our underground mining programs to Nunavut industry standards.</seg>
<seg id="173">I am pleased to announce that our college has consulted with representatives from the mining industry, such as Agnico Eagle.</seg>
<seg id="174">As employers, they have offered to provide Nunavut Arctic College with subject matter experts who will review and adapt our curriculum as necessary and to ensure that we meet the employability requirements of their industry and Nunavut’s specific Mining Regulations. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="175">Member’s Statement 535 – 4(3): Update on the Activities at Piqqusilirivvik (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="176">I rise today to ask you to join me in expressing congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="177">We know that in Clyde River the Ilisaqsivik Society is operating very well.</seg>
<seg id="178">The Ilisaqsivik Society goes to other communities to provide support and it’s all Inuit who work at Ilisaqsivik.</seg>
<seg id="179">There is no English spoken at that workplace and they do very good work.</seg>
<seg id="180">The managers and counsellors are all Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="181">They help when they are asked for help, not only from their community.</seg>
<seg id="182">They also own a brand-new hotel. All the staff there are Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="183">There is no hotel like it that I have ever stayed at.</seg>
<seg id="184">When you want to visit, we urge you to stay at that hotel in Clyde River.</seg>
<seg id="185">Member’s Statement 536 – 4(3): Recognizing Jenna Kilabuk of Pangnirtung (Okalik)</seg>
<seg id="186">I believe most of my colleagues are aware that I take extreme gratification in being an Inuk. I recall links to my skilled ancestor who survived many challenges that they overcame, which is why we can stand here today expressing our collective cultural history, which is definitely a strength of our culture that we have to re-acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="187">I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of my cousin, Geela Sowdluapik, and her grandchild, who is Jenna Kilabuk.</seg>
<seg id="188">Jenna is reaching adulthood in my old stomping grounds of Pangnirtung where she resides today. Nonetheless, all of our relatives take pride in her accomplishments irrespective of our age, adult or youth. Furthermore, she is a daughter of Rosie and Peter Kilabuk, who is no stranger to our Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="189">Jenna herself has promoted a healthy lifestyle that one wishes to follow and inspires others, as she is very dedicated in her desire to attain lifelong learning.</seg>
<seg id="190">She took it upon herself to attend courses in Belleville as well as Ottawa, as she wanted to be a physical education teacher.</seg>
<seg id="191">Today she has accomplished her goal of being a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="192">When she has the time, she also sets asides nights to residents who wish to partake in volleyball or badminton activities.</seg>
<seg id="193">Even prior to her assuming an employment position, she was active in our local community youth representation to ensure more support was derived to her fellow citizens.</seg>
<seg id="194">She was instrumental in organizing local Christmas games.</seg>
<seg id="195">She was acknowledged in 2008 with an aboriginal role model award where she exhibited many of the skills the judges were searching for, to portray successful role models.</seg>
<seg id="196">She is not solely responsible for her accomplishments, but she still exemplifies the many qualities of a role model.</seg>
<seg id="197">Although she is very young, she now owns her own private home, and she was elected to the local hamlet council.</seg>
<seg id="198">Mr. Speaker, I wish to especially single her out as an example of successful young Inuit who have accomplished much, but in terms of her success as an example of encouragement leading to an Inuk’s perseverance that leads to personal success in their lives.</seg>
<seg id="199">Member’s Statement 537 – 4(3): Government’s Strategic Framework for Nunavut Seniors (Angnakak)</seg>
<seg id="200">Mr. Speaker, as you will recall, exactly one year ago today I moved Motion 23 – 4(3), seconded by my colleague from Quttiktuq, calling on the government to address the needs of elders.</seg>
<seg id="201">Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Premier tabled the government’s Strategic Framework: Addressing the needs of Nunavut Seniors.</seg>
<seg id="202">This is a step in the right direction towards fulfilling the intent of that motion.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mr. Speaker, this document is a review of the various programs and services that are available for seniors and identifies some important restructuring of service delivery that will take place in the upcoming fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="204">Mr. Speaker, consolidating residential care for elders under the Department of Health will allow the Department of Family Services the opportunity to more effectively address the troubling issue of elder abuse. This move will also allow the Department of Health to realistically assess and plan for the growing need for residential services for elders across Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, the government’s 2015 Continuing Care in Nunavut document recommended that the government increase the capacity of residential long-term care in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="206">While I do appreciate that seven more beds are being opened at the Cambridge Bay Health Facility for long-term care and respite and palliative care, much more needs to be done to keep more of our elders at home in Nunavut, receiving care near their families and communities.</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is critical that the government continue to address the need for consistent and ongoing support for seniors in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="208">Yesterday’s tabled documents are small steps forward and I look forward to seeing more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="209">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) Members’ Statements. Hon. Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Mr. Tom Sammurtok.</seg>
<seg id="210">Member’s Statement 538 – 4(3): Sesquicentennial Reflections (Sammurtok, T)</seg>
<seg id="211">Mr. Tom Sammurtok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I rise today to offer some reflections on the occasion of the 150th year of Confederation.</seg>
<seg id="212">Mr. Speaker, earlier in this sitting I made a statement about the wonderful Qajaq Program in Chesterfield Inlet. As members will recall, I noted how this program combines modern technology and traditional skills in a way that fosters intergenerational and intercultural learning.</seg>
<seg id="213">Mr. Speaker, it has been said that our country is a work in progress. Here in Nunavut we continue our journey towards healing and reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="214">The dog slaughters, High Arctic relocations, and residential school abuses have left a painful legacy, and we must acknowledge that there are still unresolved issues today that manifest themselves in such tragic ways as suicide and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="215">However, I do believe that these can be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="216">Mr. Speaker, it has also been said that the “world needs more Canada.”</seg>
<seg id="217">I say that this is true, and I also say that Canada needs more Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="218">Mr. Speaker, during this sitting I have also raised such issues as the importance of finally connecting Nunavut to the rest of the nation by way of road.</seg>
<seg id="219">After a century and a half of existence, our country’s single largest jurisdiction should not remain so isolated and I look forward to real progress being made on the nation-building Manitoba-Kivalliq road project.</seg>
<seg id="220">Mr. Speaker, an anniversary such as the one we are marking this year calls for both reflection and anticipation.</seg>
<seg id="221">It is essential that we reflect honestly on both the positive and negative aspects of our history.</seg>
<seg id="222">By doing so, we make reconciliation possible.</seg>
<seg id="223">Mr. Speaker, I seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="224">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="225">There are none. Mr. Tom Sammurtok, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="226">Mr. Tom Sammurtok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is also essential that we look forward to the future in a way that puts the interests of our children and our children’s children first.</seg>
<seg id="228">Mr. Speaker, the Qajaq Program at Victor Sammurtok School in Chesterfield Inlet symbolizes what is best about our nation, and I ask all members to join me today in reflecting on this important anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="229">Member’s Statement 539 – 4(3): Meeting of the Kivalliq Chamber of Commerce (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="230">Before I start my statement, one of my daughters is having a birthday tomorrow. I wish Tina Mikkungwak and my older brother-in-law Robert Seeteenak a happy birthday tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="231">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to state that I and my colleague representing Rankin Inlet South, Alex Sammurtok, attended a meeting of the Kivalliq Chamber of Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="232">It was very enlightening, as we heard about interesting developments and our private sector.</seg>
<seg id="233">I also wish to thank our Premier, (interpretation ends) Premier Taptuna, (interpretation) as he was also able to partake in that meeting. He heard the same things as to what the priorities are in the Kivalliq region as well as for all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="234">I also wish to extend my gratitude to the Agnico Eagle mine operating at (interpretation ends) Meadowbank (interpretation) as well as the chairman, Jim Nasso, and Agnico Eagle senior executives.</seg>
<seg id="235">I also wish to thank the many Inuit who work at the Meadowbank mine for being warm and welcoming during our meeting at the site.</seg>
<seg id="236">It was very good to see fellow Inuit who were working at the mine.</seg>
<seg id="237">Further, we heard more concerns from the people of the Kivalliq as well as issues pertaining to all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="238">Member’s Statement 540 – 4(3): Nunavut Quest 2017 – Pangaggujjiniq (Shooyook)</seg>
<seg id="239">I rise today on a calmer issue, albeit very happily to announce an event that is not so concerning.</seg>
<seg id="240">The Nunavut Quest will be commencing their annual husky dog races in Arctic Bay on April 15. They will leave from Arctic Bay to their destination.</seg>
<seg id="241">Mr. Speaker, back in the days when the dog slaughter occurred, many communities lost their entire dog genetic pool and had no more dog teams.</seg>
<seg id="242">The Nunavut Quest was started to commemorate the Eskimo husky dog.</seg>
<seg id="243">With many dog team owners today, it is a cause for cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="244">Today I am informing my colleagues and inviting them, starting today, if you wish to observe the beginning of the race, start saving your money towards an airplane ticket to travel to Arctic Bay, provided any of the members wanted to do so.</seg>
<seg id="245">The start of this dog racing event is particularly spectacular when you see a whole bunch of dog teams, with dogs yelping and antsy to get going.</seg>
<seg id="246">This is also the case when they start to arrive into the destination community.</seg>
<seg id="247">The community welcoming the dog teams is always very ecstatic to receive them.</seg>
<seg id="248">The older generation becomes quite nostalgic and many elders become very emotional seeing the huskies, so similar to the dogs they grew up with being the cause of this celebration.</seg>
<seg id="249">This is absolutely critical both to Nunavut and Inuit culturally.</seg>
<seg id="250">The Nunavut Quest will be commencing their race in Arctic Bay. This race has been running for a number of years.</seg>
<seg id="251">We will again celebrate this unique racing event as residents of Arctic Bay.</seg>
<seg id="252">If anyone wishes to observe the race, I again invite all members and as the MLA for Quttiktuq, I warmly welcome all other residents of our communities to travel to observe the start of this race.</seg>
<seg id="253">Member’s Statement 541 – 4(3): Update on School Activities in Cape Dorset (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="254">Mr. Joanasie (interpretation): Good afternoon, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, people of Kimmirut, Cape Dorset, and Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="255">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my appreciation. As we are all aware, Cape Dorset lost its school almost two years ago now.</seg>
<seg id="256">After this tragic event, nonetheless, I stated that our education at the community would be delayed but that it would not stop. Education will continue and I want to state this for the benefit of the people in Kugaaruk</seg>
<seg id="257">However, at the time the students were able to continue their education. Last year in 2016 some students were scheduled for graduation after that school year, but this celebration will finally commence next week.</seg>
<seg id="258">I would like to congratulate:</seg>
<seg id="259">Amanda Padluq;</seg>
<seg id="260">Quppapik Samayualie;</seg>
<seg id="261">Cie Takiasuk;</seg>
<seg id="262">Kairili Qiatsuk;</seg>
<seg id="263">Mayann Samayualie; and</seg>
<seg id="264">Naiomi Ottokie.</seg>
<seg id="265">Mr. Speaker, I am immensely proud of the success of these students who continued their studies in the face of difficulties in their school year and for their dedication to continue their education.</seg>
<seg id="266">I want to single out in particular the parents of the students, the school staff, their teachers as well as the school principal, including our local DEA.</seg>
<seg id="267">Mr. Speaker, next week on March 22 they will be hold their high school graduation ceremony, where we will meet and celebrate their graduation.</seg>
<seg id="268">I want to share this happy occasion with my colleagues. I also have expectations of other graduation ceremonies with more graduates from grade 12.</seg>
<seg id="269">Member for Pangnirtung, Mr. Johnny Mike.</seg>
<seg id="270">Member’s Statement 542 – 4(3): Update on the Pangnirtung Fishery (Mike)</seg>
<seg id="271">I rise today to speak to the local efforts of Pangnirtung to derive income from our marine environment and in particular their turbot fishery.</seg>
<seg id="272">This fishery has been running for over 25 years with the commercial fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="273">The turbot fishery in particular is where Pangnirtung residents are heavily involved in, both offshore and inshore fisheries, to derive income from the commercial quota in place.</seg>
<seg id="274">I also want to mention the Pangnirtung fishermen who provide freshly caught turbot to people who want to buy turbot. The turbot fishermen comprise the majority of the winter fishery and they provide freshly caught turbot to the markets.</seg>
<seg id="275">Last year they harvested over 700,000 lbs. of turbot, shipped all over the world from our community of Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="276">Further, this fishery is in the only jurisdiction currently in Canada that provides fresh turbot, at least as far as we know, during the frigid winter.</seg>
<seg id="277">In the fish plant there are over 30 employees currently and there are 45 licensed fishermen for turbot.</seg>
<seg id="278">To date, after the winter fishery commenced last month, they have harvested close to 300,000 lbs. processed at the plant.</seg>
<seg id="279">As well, the fishermen have generated over $340,000 and this is very beneficial to the community and in particular to residents who are not employed but who derive employment from the fishery, as it allows the continuation of our traditional winter activities.</seg>
<seg id="280">The fishery started in Pangnirtung, obviously using our traditional knowledge about whaling, beluga blubber and skin processing, fur trapping, as well as ring and harp sealskin sales.</seg>
<seg id="281">This comprises a large part of our present marine resource extraction.</seg>
<seg id="282">I was quite pleased to hear about the pilot project in Pond Inlet, which was very successful with plentiful turbot.</seg>
<seg id="283">This is very pleasing to hear and I encourage communities to undertake initiatives like that.</seg>
<seg id="284">Member’s Statement 543 – 4(3): Country Food Bank in Igloolik (Quassa)</seg>
<seg id="285">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good day to the residents of my community.</seg>
<seg id="286">We see many people who don’t have enough to eat in our communities and there are food banks now that are opening up in our communities.</seg>
<seg id="287">I want my colleagues to help me in expressing gratitude to those people who create these initiatives to help other people.</seg>
<seg id="288">There is a food bank in Igloolik and I’m very proud of it because the people who run it think more along the lines of traditional Inuit food and to have Inuit food available. They have tried that.</seg>
<seg id="289">The people who run the food bank do fundraising so that some of the money can be used to help hunters and the hunters will bring back the food that can be distributed through the food bank to the needy people.</seg>
<seg id="290">I’m very proud of the fact in Igloolik that they are trying to go after traditional Inuit food for these people who generally don’t have enough food in their homes, trying to see how they can get food for them.</seg>
<seg id="291">I am very proud of them.</seg>
<seg id="292">These food banks where people go and get food really help the communities. Let’s support them and be thankful for them because they are trying to help fellow people.</seg>
<seg id="293">That’s why I rose here today.</seg>
<seg id="294">Member’s Statement 544 – 4(3): Thank You to Family Members (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="295">I would just like to take the opportunity today for one to thank all of my colleagues around this room.</seg>
<seg id="296">When we meet at this time of the year, it tends to be a very long session and there are very long hours that have been put in and a lot of hard work.</seg>
<seg id="297">I would like to acknowledge the work of the staff. People who watch us on TV hopefully realize how hard of an effort we’re putting in, but they also don’t see all the staff behind us that are working around in the long hours that we put in.</seg>
<seg id="298">I would like to take this opportunity to especially acknowledge all of our families.</seg>
<seg id="299">I know there were a number of comments made during International Women’s Day, but I would like to again just make special note.</seg>
<seg id="300">When we’re here working these long hours, it’s our families, communities, and constituents that are helping keep our communities and keeping our activities relevant to what we’re trying to accomplish here.</seg>
<seg id="301">I just want to take the time to acknowledge not just my colleagues but all the families that are at home, that are allowing us to be able to put in this hard work.</seg>
<seg id="302">Returns to Oral Questions. (interpretation ends) Hon. Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="303">Return to Oral Question 673 – 4(3): Environmental Assessment by Nunavut Impact Review Board (Ell-Kanayuk)</seg>
<seg id="304">This is a return to an oral question asked by Pauloosie Keyootak, MLA for Uqqummiut, on March 8, 2017, No. 673 – 4(3), on the environmental assessment by the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="305">The Nunavut Impact Review Board’s announcement indicated that “public engagement sessions” will be held in a number of communities, including Clyde River and Qikiqtarjuaq.</seg>
<seg id="306">It also indicated that “a final public meeting and community roundtable will be facilitated by NIRB in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="307">For the record, can the minister confirm which organization is responsible for providing support to communities during the consultation process?</seg>
<seg id="308">Mr. Speaker, the Government of Nunavut is a partner in the strategic environmental assessments administered by the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="309">This assessment concerns the future development of oil and gas related activities in the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait area.</seg>
<seg id="310">The Department of Economic Development and Transportation is an active participant in the Strategic Environmental Assessment Working Group.</seg>
<seg id="311">Its role is to support the study process, with a focus on the public education component of SEA and ensuring that Nunavummiut are well informed on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="312">Question 699 – 4(3): Senate Reform (Okalik)</seg>
<seg id="313">My question is for the Minister of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="314">The current occupant of Nunavut’s Senate seat is on record as having stated that he would resign his position after having sat in the Senate for eight years.</seg>
<seg id="315">That deadline is fast approaching.</seg>
<seg id="316">My question for the minister is simple: does the Nunavut government support the holding of an election to fill Nunavut’s Senate seat, yes or no?</seg>
<seg id="317">Premier of Nunavut, Mr. Taptuna.</seg>
<seg id="318">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="319">Mr. Speaker, I went through that tabled document and from 2009 that’s what the newly appointed Senator had indicated. He was there for eight years on the expectation that the Prime Minister may change legislation and have the Senator stay for eight years, then go on to elections.</seg>
<seg id="320">As far as I understand, I have no correspondence, no indication, or no phone call from the Prime Minister at this point, so I can’t speak on something I have no authority over; it’s a federal appointee.</seg>
<seg id="321">Once I get a good understanding of what may happen... . As far as I know, there is no legislation change for an election.</seg>
<seg id="322">Mr. Speaker, I do know that there has to be consensus from all jurisdictions, at least seven jurisdictions, to change the Senate legislation.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the past it was called Senate reform.</seg>
<seg id="324">Even though that’s the case, there was one election outside of the territory and as a consequence there was one individual that was appointed to a Senate seat.</seg>
<seg id="325">We want to be represented properly in the Senate and we would like to elect a true Nunavummiuq to that seat.</seg>
<seg id="326">I very much would like the minister to lobby the federal government to appoint a new member elected by Nunavummiut for that seat on the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="327">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Premier of Nunavut, Hon. Mr. Taptuna.</seg>
<seg id="328">As I indicated, this is a federal jurisdiction and if the member is willing to find out if there are going to be any changes in the legislation, anybody in Nunavut, including people from the south, has the authority to write to the Prime Minister or to our MP to see what the next steps are going to be.</seg>
<seg id="329">At this point I haven’t had any indication, any correspondence, or any phone calls about what the status of Senators’ seats may be.</seg>
<seg id="330">As you know, Mr. Speaker, there are nine new Senators that were appointed at that time and I believe most of them had indicated that they are willing to step aside if legislation is approved by all jurisdictions for eight-year terms moving on to elections.</seg>
<seg id="331">If there are any indications from this House that there’s a wish for an election process for Senators for Nunavut seats, we will certainly investigate that possibility.</seg>
<seg id="332">At this time anybody here is free to write to the MP to find out what the processes are and what the Prime Minister is thinking.</seg>
<seg id="333">In my next conversation with the Prime Minister, I will certainly bring that issue out and having that discussion on where his party stands on Senate reform.</seg>
<seg id="334">I believe we need to improve the process we use nowadays because the Senator who represents Nunavut, for instance, is very quick to put down Inuit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="335">Most recently a Senator from his own party stated that the old residential school system was “well intentioned.”</seg>
<seg id="336">Even though the Senator of Nunavut heard about that, he didn’t rebut that statement.</seg>
<seg id="337">It seems like he is not representing us in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="338">Nunavut deserves its own Senate representative strengthened by general election.</seg>
<seg id="339">Can the Premier lobby to get this long overdue change made?</seg>
<seg id="340">Premier of Nunavut, Mr. Peter Taptuna.</seg>
<seg id="341">Mr. Speaker, as a young territory we try to engage our federal partners in making sure that our concerns are heard, and this is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="342">This is an appointed position by the Prime Minister by the previous government and I had no say in selecting or even appointing the Senators.</seg>
<seg id="343">Mr. Speaker, if I do have a conversation with the Prime Minister, I will certainly bring that out because for the most part we do have to change our legislation, our Nunavut Elections Act, to fall into place with whatever legislation that the federal government may put in place for Senate reform.</seg>
<seg id="344">I haven’t had any indications or correspondence, but at the very next opportunity I’ll certainly bring that concern out.</seg>
<seg id="345">Again I’ve got to state that every Nunavummiuq has that opportunity to write to their MP on such concerns to bring forth how the process may be done to make Nunavut better, not only Nunavut, but people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="346">You’ve got to understand that there are efforts being made from all sides. There may be some disagreements here and there, but at the end of the day we will certainly do our part to make sure that whatever happens within the federal government, we are consulted.</seg>
<seg id="347">Question 700 – 4(3): Fur Auction House (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="348">My question is directed to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="349">Mr. Speaker, during our session last fall I was asking questions in regard to the fur auction house.</seg>
<seg id="350">Hunters who have been sending out furs, especially polar bear hides, have been waiting for years.</seg>
<seg id="351">I have been asking questions in regard to when the next auction would be.</seg>
<seg id="352">Have you heard when the next auction date is or did they not have one this year?</seg>
<seg id="353">The polar bear hides that are old were bought overpriced and have not been sold. The newer hides have been priced at a lower rate and they are being bought.</seg>
<seg id="354">The polar bear hides that are collected down at the auction house are actually depleting. That is how it is right now.</seg>
<seg id="355">Is it impossible at this time to know when the next auction will be? Although I know that this is not the minister’s jurisdiction, I would like to ask the minister if he has heard when the next fur auction will take place.</seg>
<seg id="356">Minister of Environment, Mr. Joe Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="357">I don’t have the information as to when the next auction will take place, but it is supposed to be in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="358">However, the polar bear hides at the auction house can be bought at any time of the year.</seg>
<seg id="359">Any person can go there and purchase a polar bear hide if the price is good for them.</seg>
<seg id="360">The polar bear hides that are not being purchased are because they are too expensive. At the time that the polar bear hides were purchased, the price was high and the department purchased them from the hunters.</seg>
<seg id="361">We gave half the price to the harvesters in advance and when the prices of polar bear hides went down, the money that was given to the harvesters became too expensive. That is why the polar bears are not being purchased at this time.</seg>
<seg id="362">However, there will be a fur auction this coming spring.</seg>
<seg id="363">The hunters who have sent their hides, I am not too sure, but the majority had been given an advance for the polar bear hides given to the department. If the polar bear hide is sold, then they get that part of the money given to them.</seg>
<seg id="364">That was probably the case for some of them when the price of the fur was high.</seg>
<seg id="365">What would happen if the polar bear hides cannot be purchased? Would they have to be returned to the hunters themselves and they would end up owing money because of the advance they received?</seg>
<seg id="366">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Environment, Mr. Joe Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="367">If the individuals who have polar bear hides wanted to get their polar bear hide back, then they would have to pay the advance back to the government.</seg>
<seg id="368">However, if the individual does not want the hide, then they would leave the polar bear hide in the auction house without owing money as the government had purchased it.</seg>
<seg id="369">If the harvester agrees that the government can purchase the polar bear hide at a full price and if the polar bear hide remains at the auction house, then they wouldn’t owe money for their advance.</seg>
<seg id="370">However, if they want to get their polar bear hide back, they have to pay back the advance that they had received in the past.</seg>
<seg id="371">Question 701 – 4(3): Pre-dissolution Priorities (Angnakak)</seg>
<seg id="372">Ms. Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My questions are also for the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="373">Mr. Speaker, the current Legislative Assembly will be dissolved in a little over six months from now and Nunavummiut will soon be rendering their judgment on all of us.</seg>
<seg id="374">Can the Premier indicate what the government’s top priorities are for its last six months in the office?</seg>
<seg id="375">I appreciate the question from the member.</seg>
<seg id="376">Mr. Speaker, we have many priorities, but of course together we formed our number one priority with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated with their board and we met with the board members on a couple of occasions. We met together to come up with our mandate, Sivumut Abluqta. That’s still our priority.</seg>
<seg id="377">Mr. Speaker, as you know, there were a lot of setbacks within our term here. We had three major fires. We had two schools and the power plant.</seg>
<seg id="378">That slowed things down, but our priority for the next six months is to try to complete the mandate that we have agreed together as one to try to complete the status for the benefit of Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="379">Can the Premier indicate what he believes to have been the government’s three most important achievements over the last four years?</seg>
<seg id="380">Speaker: The Hon. Premier of Nunavut, Hon. Peter Taptuna.</seg>
<seg id="381">Again I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="382">Mr. Speaker, there have been many achievements we have done through this government.</seg>
<seg id="383">As you know, in the early days through legislation we were required to review the Education Act.</seg>
<seg id="384">That’s where we initially formed the Special Committee to Review the Education Act.</seg>
<seg id="385">That was one of the biggest priorities.</seg>
<seg id="386">As you know, Mr. Speaker, that came about from legislation. The five years were up, so that was one of our tasks to complete.</seg>
<seg id="387">I feel that through the special committee, many community consultations, many back and forth and letters on the Education Act we did bring forth to the committee for them to look at.</seg>
<seg id="388">That’s quite an accomplishment.</seg>
<seg id="389">As you know, there are a lot of things that still need a lot of work.</seg>
<seg id="390">Again I’ve got to say that a lot of departments, when we lost the power plant in Pangnirtung, our people got together, our ministers and our officials, to try to rectify the situation that was dire.</seg>
<seg id="391">It’s one of those things that we fear the most, where you lose a power plant in the middle of winter, but with good cooperation and assistance from the Northwest Territories, we managed to get things working again in Pangnirtung without any accidents, injuries, or loss of life.</seg>
<seg id="392">That’s quite an accomplishment and that’s one the things that I’m quite proud of because it took a lot of departments to make sure that took place.</seg>
<seg id="393">Again, one of the things that we look at is the Public Service Act that took eight years to complete. That’s one of the things that have taken place.</seg>
<seg id="394">Mr. Speaker, there are many more accomplishments that we have done with this government.</seg>
<seg id="395">I know there’s a lot more to be done yet and that’s one of the things about governments. We could be here another hundred years and there are still going to be lots of things that we’re going to accomplish.</seg>
<seg id="396">Mr. Speaker, again, when we lost the school in Cape Dorset, it was a dire situation.</seg>
<seg id="397">Again, the ministers and officials took care of that without any loss of life. It was a dire situation.</seg>
<seg id="398">It took a lot of work from all departments, Finance, Education, Community and Government Services, and it took a lot of effort.</seg>
<seg id="399">We had to coordinate people to make sure that things were taken care of, the needs of our people and the students.</seg>
<seg id="400">Again, the situation in Kugaaruk where another school was lost, I understood that after one week the students from kindergarten up to grade 2, I believe, were already back in school. That took a lot of effort and a lot of sleepless nights for officials and ministers to accomplish that.</seg>
<seg id="401">Mr. Speaker, I’ve got to commend the members that ensured that there was open communication between the government and the community. I appreciate the efforts put forward by the regular members from Pangnirtung, Cape Dorset, and Kugaaruk when these dire situations happen.</seg>
<seg id="402">Again I thank the members for the assistance that they provided.</seg>
<seg id="403">As the Premier indicated, there is much to do yet for Nunavummiut through this government.</seg>
<seg id="404">With this in mind and in the spirit of looking forward, what advice would the Premier provide the next Assembly should he part of it or not?</seg>
<seg id="405">I don’t have a crystal ball and as usual, we do have a transition process within the government for this transition from after general elections. That’s taking place at this point where we’re making it easier for the transition into the new government.</seg>
<seg id="406">I don’t know where the new government may be and again, that’s something that we have to honour.</seg>
<seg id="407">As the outgoing government, we do make transition plans for the next government to take place.</seg>
<seg id="408">That’s one of the things we have started already at this point to make sure that once the general elections take place and there’s a new government sworn in, the transition is as painless as possible. There are many files that are ongoing and there are many things that still got to be done behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="409">Again, with the help of all the departments, we will ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible.</seg>
<seg id="410">I can’t say for sure whether we’re all going to be there, including myself. I don’t know that.</seg>
<seg id="411">That’s why I indicated that I don’t have a crystal ball, but plans are already being put in place to make the transition a lot easier going into the next government.</seg>
<seg id="412">Oral Questions. Member for Netsilik, Mr. Emiliano Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="413">Question 702 – 4(3): Status of Portable Classrooms for Kugaaruk (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="414">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="415">First I would like to express my appreciation for all the support the community of Kugaaruk has received from the Government of Nunavut, from communities all across Nunavut and (interpretation) Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="416">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, we now know that the students are getting their supplies. I thank my colleagues for approving just yesterday the $10 million for the government to move forward with its plans.</seg>
<seg id="417">For the sake of the people listening out there and (interpretation) the residents of Kugaaruk, (interpretation ends) can the minister provide an update on the specific plans for the purchase and installation of the modular classrooms in the community of Kugaaruk?</seg>
<seg id="418">Minister of Education, Mr. Paul Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="419">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank my colleague for asking for an update.</seg>
<seg id="420">I’m happy to say that we were able to carry on with that. Right now the Department of Community and Government Services is in the process of working on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="421">They are the department responsible for the assets.</seg>
<seg id="422">Currently they still have to determine and they will probably find out quickly who will be constructing the new school. They’re working on the plans as we speak.</seg>
<seg id="423">Secondly the portable classrooms that will be used for the classes are under preparation. We want to bring them into the community by this fall.</seg>
<seg id="424">Currently they are focusing on six portable classrooms to be shipped to Kugaaruk.</seg>
<seg id="425">That is happening as I speak. Obviously they are working on that development. I am also very happy that I am scheduled to travel to Kugaaruk on March 20.</seg>
<seg id="426">I appreciate that replacing the lost school is a huge task and the government has worked very hard in a short period of time to address the situation.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister provide further information on how the modular portable classrooms will be shipped to the community of Kugaaruk?</seg>
<seg id="428">The portable classrooms can only be shipped up via sealift, which is the case with most communities where bulky items are shipped. This will follow that same process. We expect that the classrooms will be put on a cargo ship scheduled to go to Kugaaruk.</seg>
<seg id="429">Question 703 – 4(3): Inuit Language Protection and Revitalization (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="430">My questions are for the Minister of Languages.</seg>
<seg id="431">Earlier this month an academic from York University published a research paper on language loss in Nunavut. I intend to table this research paper later today for the benefit of the viewing public.</seg>
<seg id="432">Mr. Speaker, in this paper the author, Mr. Ian Martin, provides his insight into the current situation of the Inuit language in our territory. In his paper, Mr. Martin also makes a number of recommendations to the federal and territorial governments.</seg>
<seg id="433">My question for the minister is: can he indicate if he has had the opportunity to review this paper titled Inuit Language Loss in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="434">I also thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Speaker, in relation to the member’s question on the study, at this time it is still in progress and we are behind schedule. However, this will be completed and I plan to table the report on this issue at our fall session scheduled for September. At this time, however, it is still under review and I have yet to see the report on it.</seg>
<seg id="436">With respect to his question, Uqausivut 2 includes many details and subjects, including what he enquired about.</seg>
<seg id="437">This work is still ongoing. Although we are behind schedule, what I can provide to the member is that phases 1, 2, 3, and 4, which are all separate phases, will be completed and this is part of the review. In particular phase 3 has many details pertinent to our regional bodies, including NTI as well as the regional Inuit associations.</seg>
<seg id="438">We will partner with them to develop this plan.</seg>
<seg id="439">That is unfortunate.</seg>
<seg id="440">This document that I will table shortly and which is the subject of my questions will be available to the minister for his information.</seg>
<seg id="441">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, subsection 24(2)(a) of the Inuit Language Protection Act says that the Minister of Languages is required to “develop policies or programs intended to promote increased learning, proficiency and linguistic vitality of the Inuit Language, including its revitalization through initiatives targeting communities or age groups in which there are special concerns about language loss or assimilation.”</seg>
<seg id="442">Can the minister tell us what specific programs are currently being undertaken by the Government of Nunavut to protect and revitalize the Inuit language?</seg>
<seg id="443">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Languages, Hon. George Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="444">Hon. George Kuksuk (interpretation): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="445">In my earlier response I indicated that many details are included in this review.</seg>
<seg id="446">We are collaborating with the regional Inuit associations as well as with NTI.</seg>
<seg id="447">The review will be completed in partnership. To reiterate, the subjects he is asking me about are included in this review.</seg>
<seg id="448">I can only speak to it upon the completion of the review and it had been scheduled for the spring, but we are a bit behind schedule.</seg>
<seg id="449">Nonetheless, it is obvious that this review will be completed by the fall session and a report will be available for tabling in the House.</seg>
<seg id="450">Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="451">Can the minister tell us today: what is the total amount of funding that the Government of Nunavut has allocated to programs designed to revitalize and protect the Inuit language for the upcoming 2017-18 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="452">Minister of Languages, Mr. Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="453">Hon. George Kuksuk (interpretation): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="454">In regard to my colleague’s question about the amount, I can’t provide that detail at this time.</seg>
<seg id="455">I have to consult with my departmental officials and once I have the amounts, I will be able to provide the funding amounts relative to his question.</seg>
<seg id="456">Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="457">Question 704 – 4(3): Support for More Daycare Spaces in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="458">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, in the past the Minister of Education has frequently stated that when his department builds a new school in a community, that school will also include space for a daycare.</seg>
<seg id="460">Sadly the plans for a new middle school in Baker Lake fell off the capital plan last year.</seg>
<seg id="461">Can the minister provide an update on what other options might be available to Baker Lake to establish another daycare in the community?</seg>
<seg id="462">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank my colleague for requesting that information. any community can establish a daycare.</seg>
<seg id="463">With respect to private daycare initiatives, this has to be done by first identifying a facility as well as establishing their own (interpretation ends) society status. (interpretation) Once the society is established, the Department of Education would be able to provide funding for their operations of the daycare.</seg>
<seg id="464">Our department is not responsible for acquiring facilities specific to daycares. The initiative has to come from the community.</seg>
<seg id="465">With the establishment of the society, the funding becomes available for the operations of the daycare.</seg>
<seg id="466">I can only encourage the residents of Baker Lake to identify a building for a future daycare space as well as the society status, as our department waits for applications for a future daycare, if they wish to operate it.</seg>
<seg id="467">We just wait for applications.</seg>
<seg id="468">I recognize that the government’s decision not to build a new middle school in Baker Lake is due to problems with attendance.</seg>
<seg id="469">I can assure the minister that the community is working hard to address this issue.</seg>
<seg id="470">The last school to be built in Baker Lake was the Jonah Amitnaaq School. It was supposed to have a daycare, but currently there isn’t one.</seg>
<seg id="471">Can the minister explain why some new schools include daycares and others don’t?</seg>
<seg id="472">Minister of Education, Mr. Paul Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="473">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="474">Yes, indeed my colleague is truthful in bringing up the fact that not all schools have daycare spaces while some of the newer schools such as the one in Naujaat and newer schools include a daycare facility.</seg>
<seg id="475">The need for daycare facilities was recognized and new school designs and/or school additions do include that, as this requirement was established after the construction of the Jonah Amitnaaq School was completed.</seg>
<seg id="476">That is the situation today.</seg>
<seg id="477">Obviously, as per my many references to that fact, new school designs or school additions include the requirement for daycare space.</seg>
<seg id="478">This is the current requirement, but many of our schools don’t have daycare spaces as this requirement for such a facility was decided after the completion of those schools.</seg>
<seg id="479">As an example, it occurred with the Jonah Amitnaaq School, which is the case today.</seg>
<seg id="480">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="481">As long as the capital plan does not include a new middle school for Baker Lake, then the option of including a new daycare in that new school will also be on hold.</seg>
<seg id="482">Will the minister commit to working with the community of Baker Lake through its DEA and other local organizations to identify other opportunities to establish more daycare spaces and to provide the necessary support to get those spaces open for those who need them?</seg>
<seg id="483">Our students who may have been able to attend school if there were more daycare spaces are currently unable to attend.</seg>
<seg id="484">The need for more daycare spaces in our community of Baker Lake is extremely important as it would result in students being able to attend their classes as required.</seg>
<seg id="485">Minister of Education, Mr. Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Department of Education works on these issues through the (interpretation ends) Early Childhood Education (interpretation) Division and we have a full complement of staff. Our employees are able to work with local communities, such as Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="487">Perhaps the local DEA can invite the officials to meet with them and the specialists in the (interpretation ends) early childhood division (interpretation) will be available from our offices. We have these positions in our offices.</seg>
<seg id="488">Further, I want my colleague to be aware that we’re going to start reviewing the Child Day Care Act and ascertain what improvements are required to better manage daycares we operate. We will do a comprehensive review of the (interpretation ends) Child Care Act (interpretation) and my expectations are that there will be improvements.</seg>
<seg id="489">I want to reiterate what I said earlier about the local DEAs, such as in Baker Lake, that can submit their application for assistance or if they want further information on establishing new daycare facilities so that this initiative can move forward.</seg>
<seg id="490">I just want my colleague to know that.</seg>
<seg id="491">Question 705 – 4(3): Departmental Positions (Enook)</seg>
<seg id="492">My questions today are for the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="493">Mr. Speaker, during Saturday’s sitting of the House the minister committed to getting back to me with detailed information concerning my questions about her department’s positions in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="494">I appreciate having received a letter earlier today which indicated that the position of transportation programs officer in Pond Inlet is currently filled on an indeterminate basis.</seg>
<seg id="495">For the record, can the minister confirm the total number of positions that her department currently has filled in Pond Inlet?</seg>
<seg id="496">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="497">Yes, I do have the information for all of Nunavut where our department has positions. There are approximately 136 positions in total, of which 97 positions are filled and 35 positions are vacant.</seg>
<seg id="498">Specific to Pond Inlet, our department has… .</seg>
<seg id="499">Although this information isn’t completely updated, there are perhaps eight positions in Pond Inlet out of nine in total.</seg>
<seg id="500">There is one position for the (interpretation ends) senior finance and administrative officer (interpretation) that is not actually based in Pond Inlet, but it is currently open.</seg>
<seg id="501">If there are eight positions that are filled in Pond Inlet, for the record, can she confirm how many of these positions are currently filled on indeterminate basis and how many are currently filled on a term or casual basis?</seg>
<seg id="502">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="503">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member. They’re all indeterminate positions.</seg>
<seg id="504">For the record, can the minister confirm which of her department’s Pond Inlet positions are currently vacant?</seg>
<seg id="505">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="506">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member.</seg>
<seg id="507">The letter we gave to the chair of the committee does not state or identify, but there doesn’t seem to be any vacant positions at this time in Pond Inlet.</seg>

<seg id="509">Member for Hudson Bay, Mr. Allan Rumbolt.</seg>
<seg id="510">Question 706 – 4(3): Update on the Activities Schedule of MV Nuliajuk (Rumbolt)</seg>
<seg id="511">Mr. Rumbolt: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, members. Good afternoon to the people of Sanikiluaq.</seg>
<seg id="512">Mr. Speaker, my questions today are for the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="513">As the minister will recall, I asked him a number of questions concerning the activities of the government’s research vessel during our recent fall sitting.</seg>
<seg id="514">In his response, the minister indicated that his department had recently lapsed its five-year plan for the research vessel and that there would be a meeting early in 2017 to plan a schedule of activities for the vessel.</seg>
<seg id="515">Can the minister explain how the government determines the schedule of activities for its research vessel?</seg>
<seg id="516">Minister of Environment, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="517">The priorities of the research vessel are determined by the research meetings that occur there.</seg>
<seg id="518">What projects that the proponents want to do are all put there, including the funding and where they’re coming from.</seg>
<seg id="519">The people who run the boat, the people for environment, and the people who are doing the studies meet there and they come up with a plan and prioritize which projects they will do a research on in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="520">I also asked the minister last fall what activities the research vessel would undertake in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="521">In his response, he stated that there would be a meeting in January/February to determine the activities.</seg>
<seg id="522">Can the minister tell us what the government’s research vessel will be used for during the upcoming 2017-18 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="523">Minister of Environment, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="524">The vessel will be used for researching in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="525">Mr. Speaker, the list has not come back to me yet.</seg>
<seg id="526">Hudson Bay is a large inland sea that seems to be rich in underwater marine life.</seg>
<seg id="527">Can the minister indicate when we can expect to see the research vessel collecting data in the waters surrounding the Belcher Islands?</seg>
<seg id="528">Minister of Environment, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="529">Unfortunately I can’t tell the member when that will be. A lot of the research that is done is external funding.</seg>
<seg id="530">It is done through external funding as the funding that we have to do the research in Nunavut is limited. Like I told you, I have not got the results back of what research they want to do within Nunavut yet.</seg>
<seg id="531">The hamlet or the HTO in Sanikiluaq can put a proposal in and say what they want studied.</seg>
<seg id="532">I’m not saying it’s going to be done, but it would be looked at. They were doing some studies around Chesterfield Inlet and Wager Bay last year.</seg>
<seg id="533">If there are resources to be studied around Sanikiluaq and the funding is there, then I don’t see why it shouldn’t be done.</seg>
<seg id="534">The meetings dictate where they go and as of now I don’t know where the research is going to be done.</seg>
<seg id="535">Question 707 – 4(3): Recommendations of Nunavut’s Coroner (Okalik)</seg>
<seg id="536">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="537">As we are aware, the work of the department is piling up, especially when there was a coroner’s inquest into one of my constituents in January, and then there was the Auditor General of Canada’s report on the hospital and its recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="538">For the benefit of hospital patients, will your department ensure that it will respond to the recommendations in these reports before going on to other tasks?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health, Mr. George Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="540">I appreciate the member speaking on behalf of the coroner’s report of the incident that happened and I can ensure the member that the Department of Health is looking over the recommendations from the report itself.</seg>
<seg id="541">That being said, there are also a number of recommendations from the Office of the Auditor General’s report that have overlapped.</seg>
<seg id="542">We will be able to track the progress of that through the action plan that will be forthcoming, that will be shared with committee members prior to the Office of the Auditor General’s appearance in the public accounts committee.</seg>
<seg id="543">Your first supplementary, Mr. Okalik.</seg>
<seg id="544">Mr. Okalik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I know the department is under barrage at times, but I feel that health care for Nunavummiut is and lives matter.</seg>
<seg id="545">I stress that the minister stay focused and report on the findings from the department on these two reports in particular.</seg>
<seg id="546">When can the minister report on these matters in the future?</seg>
<seg id="547">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Health, Hon. George Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="548">I appreciate the member’s acknowledgement of the work that goes into when reports of this nature are brought to the attention of the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="549">It may be a little bit off topic, but I am going to use it as a segue into informing this House that, because of all these reports that have come to the attention to the Department of Health; the Office of the Auditor General’s report, the recent coroner’s report, in addition to the privacy commissioner’s report upcoming; I have instructed the department to delay the implementation of the advisory board of the QGH.</seg>
<seg id="550">Health care provision to Nunavummiut is a priority and that is where we need to focus what limited resources we have on.</seg>
<seg id="551">At this time, like I said, I have instructed the department to delay the implementation of that board.</seg>
<seg id="552">Yes, I agree. I know that it is very important. We need to get over and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="553">I would like to ask the minister when his department is going to respond to the recommendations. When will we be expecting a response to the report? Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="554">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. Minister of Health, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="555">Hon. George Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. While I can’t commit to a specific time, I can assure the member and all members that when reports of this nature or topics of this nature come to the Department of Health, especially when we are dealing with the quality of care, it is the priority of the Department of Health to make sure that we not only respond to recommendations, but that we implement action behind those recommendations to make sure that incidents like the member has brought up don’t happen again, for one.</seg>
<seg id="556">The department has taken a number of steps through our continuous quality improvement.</seg>
<seg id="557">We’ve got designated people tasked to make sure that the quality of care for Nunavummiut is consistent across the territory and that the level of care that is being provided is what they expect and what they should expect.</seg>
<seg id="558">Oral Questions. Member for Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu, Ms. Pat Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="559">Question 708 – 4(3): Negotiating Non-Insured Health Benefits (Angnakak)</seg>
<seg id="560">Ms. Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="561">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="562">Mr. Speaker, during this recent sitting my colleagues and I have raised a number of issues with respect to funding for health services.</seg>
<seg id="563">With respect to a number of issues, such as medical travel and accommodation, for example, the minister has often indicated that the costs related to providing their services are closely tied in with what is covered under the Non-Insured Health Benefits Program.</seg>
<seg id="564">Can the Minister of Health clearly describe the process that is followed when he and his staff attempt to negotiate for additional financial support from the federal Non-Insured Health Benefits Program?</seg>
<seg id="565">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Health, Mr. George Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="566">Hon. George Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="567">The member’s timing is impeccable. Negotiations are ongoing, as I stand here, with Health Canada specifically on non-insured health benefits funding and care that’s provided through that agreement.</seg>
<seg id="568">That being said, those discussions don’t just happen when an agreement comes to its sunset. There are continual conversations that occur on establishing rates for boarding homes, medical travel, food allowances, and prescription care.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are a number of different factors that play into the continuous dialogue that happens with Health Canada on the provision through non-insured health benefits.</seg>
<seg id="570">That being said, I am very much looking forward to see how negotiations continue to progress with this next phase of our agreement with Health Canada on NIHB.</seg>
<seg id="571">Ms. Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="572">I recognize that medical travel and accommodation are only two of the benefits provided for under the Non-Insured Health Benefits Program. The NIHB program also covers certain dental services, pharmaceuticals, and vision care.</seg>
<seg id="573">Can the minister clearly explain who decides what dental services, pharmaceuticals, and types of vision care are going to be covered under the NIHB program and who decides how much the program will pay for each of those items or services?</seg>
<seg id="574">Minister of Health, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="575">Hon. George Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="576">That’s a very good question. When we negotiate a lot of our agreements in general with Health Canada, but specifically to NIHB, they still have control over the rates of what we receive from the services that we act on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="577">An example, escort travel is not covered through NIHB.</seg>
<seg id="578">That turns out to be a government Department of Health expense.</seg>
<seg id="579">When we’re talking about prescription drugs of what makes the list, those are discussions that occur with Health Canada on what specific pharmaceuticals would be covered.</seg>
<seg id="580">It’s a collaborative effort, but at the same time it is a federal program that we administer on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="581">Like I had mentioned, there are a number of discussions that happen ongoing, but at the end of the day it is a federal program that the Government of Nunavut administers on behalf of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="582">The Non-Insured Health Benefits Program is coordinated under the federal government’s First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, as the minister stated, and it appears that the benefits are identical for First Nations and Inuit clients.</seg>
<seg id="583">However, it is well known that the costs for products and services are much higher in Nunavut than in the south.</seg>
<seg id="584">Can the minister describe how the benefit amounts for products and services under NIHB are reviewed and calculated? How is it taken into account when we have higher costs here in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="585">Minister of Health, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="586">Hon. George Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="587">The member is preaching to the choir.</seg>
<seg id="588">That is my exact argument and the argument that the department continuously puts forward to Health Canada to acknowledge the higher costs associated with providing health care in Nunavut all across the board, not just under the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, but in addition to all the services.</seg>
<seg id="589">We do have agreements with other jurisdictions on reciprocal billing where rates are established and set for procedures to be accessed in other jurisdictions.</seg>
<seg id="590">I can’t speak to what benefits First Nations get on specifics.</seg>
<seg id="591">All I know is that the agreement that we have with Health Canada, like I had said, it’s a continual adventure, I’m going to call it, of educating our federal counterparts in acknowledging the level of care that we need to provide, considering the limitations that we have geographically and economically.</seg>
<seg id="592">It is an argument that I make every opportunity I get to any of my counterparts across the country, not just the federal side of things.</seg>
<seg id="593">We rely upon NWT, Alberta, Manitoba, and Ontario to provide health care for our residents out of our different regions.</seg>
<seg id="594">There’s continual dialogue and there’s a lot of support that I’ve had verbally and in any correspondence I’ve had with my other counterparts in other jurisdictions.</seg>
<seg id="595">It is an ongoing effort to make sure that other people recognize the high level of costs.</seg>
<seg id="596">The more statistics and more data that gets gathered, the more information that we’re gathering through our own department help lend credence to our argument to move forward in sustainable, appropriate funding for health care.</seg>

<seg id="604">(interpretation) Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="605">Question 709 – 4(3): Need for More Elders Facilities in Nunavut (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="606">My questions are for the Minister of Culture and Heritage.</seg>
<seg id="607">Mr. Speaker, during our recent fall sitting my colleague, the Member for Gjoa Haven, tabled the resolutions from the 2016 Annual General Meeting of the Kitikmeot Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="608">In these resolutions the Kitikmeot elders delegation expressed their need for “funding opportunities for infrastructure, operation and maintenance funding for elders’ buildings in the Kitikmeot.”</seg>
<seg id="609">Mr. Speaker, these types of buildings include designated spaces for elders to meet with one another and other members of their communities to discuss important issues, such as cultural development and community crime prevention initiatives.</seg>
<seg id="610">Mr. Speaker, according to its current 2016-19 business plan the Department of Culture and Heritage has allocated $405,000 to its Elders Support Program which “supports community-based Elder initiatives throughout Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="611">Can the minister clarify if his department’s Elders Support Program can provide funding for the development or maintenance of elders buildings in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="612">Minister of Culture and Heritage, Mr. George Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="613">Hon. George Kuksuk (interpretation): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I also thank my colleague for his question.</seg>
<seg id="614">Mr. Speaker, I understand his question on the communities having a meeting place for elders and youth.</seg>
<seg id="615">The communities can put in proposals for that. If there was a building in the community to renovate it for the elders and youth to meet at and if there’s a request for such a proposal, the Department of Culture and Heritage can provide them funding for the renovation. If the community can identify a building that can be used, for instance, to his question, we have funding available for renovations for that building in the community.</seg>
<seg id="616">He didn’t quite answer my question, so I’ll ask him again.</seg>
<seg id="617">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, our elders need a designated space where they can meet with youth to discuss ways to reduce crime and violence in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="618">Can the minister clearly explain how his department’s Elders Support Program ensures that each community has this type of designated space?</seg>
<seg id="619">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Culture and Heritage, Hon. George Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="620">As I said earlier, maybe the Inuktitut, because of our dialects, maybe he didn’t quite understand what I said.</seg>
<seg id="621">Mr. Speaker, what I’m saying is our department has funds available where any community that wish to renovate or fix up a building in the community that they wish to use towards our elders and our youth to use to do whatever activities they would like to do in the community.</seg>
<seg id="622">I cannot say which communities that are not being used but could be fixed up to be used to have groups like my hon. friend is mentioning, elders and youth to use it for meetings and whatever.</seg>
<seg id="623">I can tell the member that we have funds available for such buildings where they can renovate it and get it fixed so that they can use that building to have their meetings and whatever in the community.</seg>
<seg id="624">He answered the question I was going to ask, so I don’t need to ask it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="625">Question 710 – 4(3): Dust Control Initiatives (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="626">My questions are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="627">Earlier during this sitting my colleague, the Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, asked the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation a number of questions concerning dust control in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="628">In her response, the minister stated that “$2.5 million will be used for dust suppressants.</seg>
<seg id="629">Since it’s going to be a feasibility study, we are going to be including different types of dust suppressants.”</seg>
<seg id="630">Can the Minister of Community and Government Services clarify if his department will still be responsible for dust control initiatives in Nunavut’s communities and, if so, can he clarify how exactly his department will be sharing this role with the Department of Economic Development and Transportation?</seg>
<seg id="631">Just to clarify first that I can’t speak for the Department of Economic Development’s budget and their intended use of their budget, but I can speak to dust control in my department.</seg>
<seg id="632">We fund the municipalities for dust control and we will still continue to do that.</seg>
<seg id="633">As the minister is aware, I have raised concerns regarding the need for more effective dust suppressants in Baker Lake on many occasions in this House.</seg>
<seg id="634">In my community we are unable to apply calcium chloride on our airport road due to its proximity to the community’s runway, resulting in large amounts of dust rising and moving through the community during summer months.</seg>
<seg id="635">Mr. Speaker, this is a significant issue for residents in my community, as it negatively affects air quality and individuals with respiratory problems.</seg>
<seg id="636">Can the minister indicate if his department has conducted any research to determine what other types of dust suppressants could be used on Baker Lake’s airport road and, if not, why not?</seg>
<seg id="637">Minister of Community and Government Services, Mr. Joe Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="638">The member is correct in terms of calcium chloride being a corrosive.</seg>
<seg id="639">Mr. Speaker, last year we had a pilot project to test a different dust suppressant product called Dustop.</seg>
<seg id="640">There are certain conditions that have to be met for it to be fully functional.</seg>
<seg id="641">At that time the results for Iqaluit were inconclusive due to weather conditions.</seg>
<seg id="642">In Arviat they cancelled the test pilot altogether because it was raining and it was too cold in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="643">This summer they will be testing it there and this product can be put on airport roads.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the outcome of this product, we may or may not use it for other communities to come because it is four or five times more expensive than calcium chloride, but if it lasts longer and if it’s cost-effective, we will look into it.</seg>
<seg id="645">We will look at any other products that might help the dust problem in Nunavut because the member is concerned about dust in Baker Lake, but I have heard from almost all the MLAs. It is a concern in all the communities and we would like to come up with a viable solution.</seg>
<seg id="646">Currently we use calcium chloride because, when laid down properly, it is effective and it’s the most economical means that we have right now to try to suppress drugs in Nunavut…dust.</seg>
<seg id="647">Speaker (interpretation): Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Mikkungwak: Mr. Speaker, the ultimate solution to dust control in our communities would be to pave the roads, but I recognize that paving all of Nunavut’s roads is not feasible at this time.</seg>
<seg id="649">However, there is an alternative method which involves applying a solution to gravel roads, which binds the gravel and dust together with a solution that forms a pavement-like foundation. This method is often referred to as a “poor man’s pavement.”</seg>
<seg id="650">Can the minister clarify if his department has looked into the feasibility of using this approach on Nunavut’s roads?</seg>
<seg id="651">We’re always looking at other options and we have read up on other options. We have not tried any other options in Nunavut. We have read up on a few; we have not tried them.</seg>
<seg id="652">We just take one product at a time. We will see how this Dustop product works and if it works well, then that’s what we might go with.</seg>
<seg id="653">If it doesn’t work out well, then we will look at the next step.</seg>
<seg id="654">This Dustop sounds good, but there has to be no rain, it has to be above 5 degrees, and traffic cannot go on it for 24 hours. It has limitations on where it can be, but we will check this product first, just one step at a time. If this product is not viable, then we will take the next step and try another product.</seg>
<seg id="655">We fully want to take the dust problem head-on, but we’ve got to do it economically.</seg>

<seg id="781">To my right is my Deputy Minister, Rebekah Williams, and Legal Counsel Thomas Ahlfors.</seg>
<seg id="782">Ms. Williams and Mr. Ahlfors, welcome to the House.</seg>
<seg id="783">Minister Mike, if you have any opening comments, you have the floor now.</seg>
<seg id="784">Hon. Johnny Mike (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="785">Members of the Committee of the Whole, I am pleased to be here today to speak to the proposed changes to the Social Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="786">The bill to amend the Social Assistance Act is part of the Department of Family Services’ ongoing efforts to review and reform income assistance.</seg>
<seg id="787">The Income Assistance Program provides assistance to vulnerable Nunavummiut to meet their basic needs and supports individuals and families in moving towards independence and self-reliance through a variety of programs.</seg>
<seg id="788">(interpretation ends) In Sivumut Abluqta our government committed to help Nunavummiut reduce their dependence on government.</seg>
<seg id="789">To accomplish this, we are committed to review and reform our Income Assistance Program.</seg>
<seg id="790">As you know, over the past year my department and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation travelled across Nunavut to hear from Nunavummiut about how our programs can better serve communities.</seg>
<seg id="791">We heard clearly that we can improve the current system so that it does a better job helping Nunavummiut meet their basic needs and encourages Nunavummiut to work.</seg>
<seg id="792">Last June we tabled our final report on the review and reform of income assistance and economic development, which outlines a number of proposed reforms to accomplish this goal.</seg>
<seg id="793">(interpretation) One of these reforms under the category of strengthening internal administration is updating the Social Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="794">The Social Assistance Act provides the legal authority for the Income Assistance Program.</seg>
<seg id="795">During our preliminary review of the program, we had identified that the Act would benefit from a number of modest updates, such as replacing outdated terms, updating content related to privacy legislation, and shifting some elements to regulations. Specifically the bill to amend the Social Assistance Act includes the following proposed changes:</seg>
<seg id="796">Changing the name of the Act from Social Assistance Act to Income Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="797">“Income assistance” is the umbrella term for all programs that provide support to vulnerable Nunavummiut to meet their basic needs.</seg>
<seg id="798">This includes social assistance but also, for example, the daycare user subsidy and the senior fuel subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="799">Changing the name of the Social Assistance Act will improve the clarity of the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="800">(interpretation ends) Updating and removing terms that are out of date. This includes, for example, references to “welfare.”</seg>
<seg id="801">Strengthening content related to privacy legislation. The bill adds new content to specify under what circumstances the department may collect and use personal information to align with requirements under the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act.</seg>
<seg id="802">This is especially important since the current Social Assistance Act was created before the introduction of the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act.</seg>
<seg id="803">Standardizing content related to the appeals process.</seg>
<seg id="804">Although the appeals process itself will not change, the bill proposes to move sections of the appeals process to regulations, which will allow the department flexibility to improve the appeals process on an ongoing basis by requiring a regulation change rather than a change to the Act. The amendment also strengthens the independence of the appeal board by clarifying that Department of Family Services’ staff cannot be members of the board.</seg>
<seg id="805">Together the proposed changes to the Act are meant to improve the administration of income assistance programs, provide more clarity on the program, as well as strengthen the Act’s provisions for privacy and confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="806">I will also note that although the changes to the Act are considered minor, the broader work on the income assistance review and reform is ongoing. As most of the income assistance rules are set out in regulation rather than in legislation, many of the reforms we are aiming to implement can be made without legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="807">(interpretation) With the 20 proposed reforms we outlined in the final report on the review and reform of income assistance and economic development, Nunavummiut will be able to engage with an income assistance system that is more focused on their strengths and goals.</seg>
<seg id="808">Those that need help will receive it, and there will be stronger supports to help Nunavummiut build their skills, work in the wage economy, or through traditional livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="809">(interpretation ends) We still have more work to do to turn these proposed reforms into real changes. (interpretation) I look forward to continuing to update members on progress on each of these reforms, and I thank you for your support in moving this important work ahead.</seg>
<seg id="810">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Mike.</seg>
<seg id="811">Does the Chair of the Standing Committee on Legislation have opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="812">As Chair of the Standing Committee on Legislation, I wish to make some opening comments as the Committee of the Whole begins its consideration of Bill 26, An Act to Amend the Social Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="813">The standing committee recognizes that Bill 26 was introduced to amend the current legislation by updating terminology, improving the operations of the appeals process by moving it to regulations, and to address the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.</seg>
<seg id="814">Amending the current legislation was one of the recommendations in the government’s report on the review and reform of income assistance and economic development which was tabled in June of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="815">Standing committee members appreciate that implementing the other recommendations of that report may also include additional changes to regulations and policy as well as a number of other initiatives. Members encourage the minister and his staff to ensure that information with respect to revised or new regulations associated with the legislation is shared with Members of the Assembly at the earliest opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="816">Mr. Chairman, while the standing committee accepts that a number of the proposed amendments to the current legislation will improve the income assistance appeals process, members expressed some concern with the length of time allocated for that process to be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="817">Clients who have been denied income assistance could wait up to 30 days to receive a resolution regarding their appeal of that decision.</seg>
<seg id="818">Members were of the view that this is a long time to wait without being able to buy food to feed a family and recommend that future revisions of the regulations address this issue.</seg>
<seg id="819">Mr. Chairman, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Nunavut’s Information and Privacy Commissioner for her input during the standing committee’s review of Bill 26.</seg>
<seg id="820">Her comments and observations relating to the access, use, and disclosure of personal information collected under the auspices of the legislation reinforced the standing committee’s position that the bill needed to be strengthened with respect to the protection of privacy of income assistance clients.</seg>
<seg id="821">The standing committee was therefore in full support of an amendment to clause 13 of Bill 26 to ensure that information collected under the Act will only be used for clearly specified and prescribed purposes, that any information-sharing agreements will put limits on the disclosure of personal information, and that retention and destruction schedules of information collected will be included.</seg>
<seg id="822">Another amendment to the bill under clause 12 clarifies the reference to taxation laws to specifically refer to the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax Act (Canada).</seg>
<seg id="823">Mr. Chairman, the standing committee welcomed the opportunity to work with the minister to strengthen and improve Bill 26, An Act to Amend the Social Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="824">The standing committee recommends the passage of Bill 26, as amended and reprinted, to all members.</seg>
<seg id="825">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="826">Are there any general comments to the opening comments by Minister Mike and Mr. Sammurtok?</seg>
<seg id="827">If there are none, let’s go to Bill 26 in your legislation binder. We will begin the clause-by-clause review of Bill 26. Please indicate if you have any questions as we’re going through the bill.</seg>
<seg id="828">I will proceed.</seg>
<seg id="829">I have the English copy, so I’ll read it in English.</seg>
<seg id="830">It reads, (interpretation ends) Bill 26, An Act to Amend the Social Assistance Act. (interpretation) Clause 1.</seg>
<seg id="831">I would like to ask the minister a question related to collection and use of personal information.</seg>
<seg id="832">I would like to know how you will go about ensuring that the clients using the service who must provide written consent absolutely understand what they’re consenting to.</seg>
<seg id="833">I also thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="834">Yes, this issue relates to the implementation of the Social Assistance Act. When the legislation started being used, the matter of confidentiality arose and due to that issue surfacing, the issues surrounding confidentiality became clear.</seg>
<seg id="835">That is included in the amendments to the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="836">I want that clearly understood, especially by the listening audience.</seg>
<seg id="837">With that being the case, amendments have been made to undertake these changes.</seg>
<seg id="838">Now a client served by the department is included in the compiling of the information and they are required to sign a form due to the confidentiality issues that arise from providing their personal information and to allow the social worker to release this information to other officials they have to work with. This is part of the process to protect confidentiality of a client served by a social worker, as they have to consent to the information that applies to them.</seg>
<seg id="839">The information can be shared only with their consent.</seg>
<seg id="840">This legislation is to protect confidentiality of the client and within the parameters of the protection of privacy legislation.</seg>
<seg id="841">That would allow the client to be served and to abide with our existing legislation.</seg>
<seg id="842">Ms. Angnakak, are you done?</seg>
<seg id="843">We are reviewing Bill 26.</seg>
<seg id="844">I’ll continue where I left off.</seg>
<seg id="845">Clause 13.</seg>
<seg id="846">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 19. Do you agree?</seg>

<seg id="852">Members, pursuant to Rule 62(2), do you agree that Bill 26 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="853">Minister Mike, if you have any closing remarks, I give you the opportunity to make them.</seg>
<seg id="854">I would like to thank my two officials here at the witness table and the staff in our department.</seg>
<seg id="855">I would like to tell the people of Nunavut that we will be making changes to our legislation.</seg>
<seg id="856">I would like to thank the people of Nunavut who participated in the consultation process.</seg>
<seg id="857">We have proposed to make some changes to this Act.</seg>
<seg id="858">I thank the people of Nunavut and the people that I work with at the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="859">I also thank the committee.</seg>
<seg id="860">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Mike.</seg>
<seg id="861">We will proceed and before we do, Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the minister’s officials out.</seg>
<seg id="862">We will be dealing with Bill 28.</seg>
<seg id="863">If you would like to get ready for the next bill, we will be dealing with Bill 28.</seg>
<seg id="864">Minister Savikataaq, we will be working with you on Bill 28.</seg>
<seg id="865">I would first like to ask if you want to have officials join you at the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="866">Bill 28 – An Act to Amend Certain Acts Respecting Codes and Standards – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="867">Minister Savikataaq would like to have officials with him at the witness table. Members, do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="868">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the minister’s officials in.</seg>
<seg id="869">Minister Savikataaq, for the record, please introduce your officials.</seg>
<seg id="870">To my right I have Ms. Lori Kimball, the DM, and to my left is Mr. Eiryn Devereaux, the ADM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="871">Ms. Kimball and Mr. Devereaux, welcome to the House.</seg>
<seg id="872">Minister Savikataaq, if you have any opening comments on Bill 28, I give you the opportunity to make them.</seg>
<seg id="873">These proposed amendments to the Technical Standards and Safety Act (TSSA) and the Building Code Act (BCA) are meant to ensure that these two “companion” pieces of legislation are consistent in how they deal with safety issues related to the design, construction, and operation of buildings, facilities, and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="874">The major changes to these two pieces of legislation that are under these amendments include:</seg>
<seg id="875">Expand the role of the Building Advisory Committee to include TSSA matters. This means that designers, builders, and others who seek permits and approvals under both pieces of legislation will now have the same opportunity to seek redress related to regulatory officials’ decisions and to inform potential independent advice to the minister under the TSSA than they will under the BCA once both are proclaimed.</seg>
<seg id="876">Provide a distinction between regulatory functions of “inspection” and “investigation.”</seg>
<seg id="877">Amend municipal legislation to remove the authority to pass by-laws adopting and modifying the Building Codes of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="878">Amend the administrative penalties provision to make them an absolute liability standard (TSSA).</seg>
<seg id="879">I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and colleagues for this opportunity to review the proposed changes in this bill.</seg>
<seg id="880">I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have.</seg>
<seg id="881">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="882">Does the Chair of the Standing Committee on Legislation have opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="883">Mr. Tom Sammurtok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) As Chair of the Standing Committee on Legislation, I wish to make some opening comments as the Committee of the Whole begins its consideration of Bill 28, An Act to Amend Certain Acts Respecting Codes and Standards.</seg>
<seg id="884">As members will recall, Bill 28 received second reading on October 25, 2016 and was referred to the Standing Committee on Legislation for consideration.</seg>
<seg id="885">The standing committee supports the intent of Bill 28, An Act to Amend Certain Acts Respecting Codes and Standards.</seg>
<seg id="886">During the minister’s recent appearance before the standing committee on the occasion of its clause-by-clause consideration of Bill 28, a total of fives motion were moved to amend the bill. For the benefit of Nunavummiut who are following our proceedings today, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the major amendments to Bill 28.</seg>
<seg id="887">Clause 7 of Bill 28 has been amended to ensure that a building official’s power to collect and disclose information during the course of their inspections or investigations of a building is only used to the extent that is necessary for the purposes of fulfilling their duties under the Building Code Act, or otherwise authorized by a warrant.</seg>
<seg id="888">Similarly a new clause has been added to Bill 28 to ensure that an inspector’s power to collect and disclose information during the course of their inspections or investigations of equipment is only used to the extent that is necessary for the purposes of fulfilling their duties under the Technical Standards and Safety Act, or otherwise authorized by a warrant.</seg>
<seg id="889">Mr. Chairman, the standing committee had raised the issue of the collection and disclosure of information under the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="890">The standing committee encourages the government to ensure that the collection and disclosure of information under the Building Code Act and the Technical Standards and Safety Act is undertaken strictly for the purposes of implementing the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="891">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="892">The standing committee recommends the passage of Bill 28 to all members.</seg>
<seg id="893">Are there any general comments on the opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="894">If there are none, please refer to Bill 28 in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="895">If you want to comment, please raise your hand and indicate clearly.</seg>
<seg id="896">Let’s begin the clause-by-clause review of the bill.</seg>

<seg id="922">Minister Savikataaq, if you have any closing remarks, I now give you the opportunity to make them.</seg>
<seg id="923">I would like to thank all of my staff here and everyone else who worked hard on this legislation to get it done and get it done to the satisfaction of the members to pass it.</seg>
<seg id="924">I would like to thank the members for reading it thoroughly because it is pretty dry reading.</seg>
<seg id="925">I thank you for making Nunavut a safer place to live and work now.</seg>
<seg id="926">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="927">We will proceed to Bill 30.</seg>
<seg id="928">Minister Savikataaq, we will be reviewing the bill with you.</seg>
<seg id="929">I would like to ask you if you would like to have the same officials with you at the witness table or if you would like to bring in other officials.</seg>
<seg id="930">I will be keeping the same staff here.</seg>
<seg id="931">Bill 30 – An Act to Amend the Fire Prevention Act – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="932">If you have any opening comments on Bill 30, Minister Savikataaq, I now give you the floor.</seg>
<seg id="933">These amendments to the Fire Protection Act are meant to address current inconsistencies with the Fire Prevention Act compatibility with the new Building Code Act.</seg>
<seg id="934">The major changes to the legislation under these amendments include:</seg>
<seg id="935">Change the name from the Fire Prevention Act to the Fire Safety Act,</seg>
<seg id="936">Expand the current Fire Prevention Act to cover both fire prevention and fire protection,</seg>
<seg id="937">Require municipalities to make and maintain a fire protection plan that would be consistent across the territory relative to standards of fire protection,</seg>
<seg id="938">Make consequential amendments to the Fire Prevention Act that recognize statutory provisions in the Building Code Act, and</seg>
<seg id="939">Expand the role of the Building Advisory Committee to include Fire Safety Act matters.</seg>
<seg id="940">I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and colleagues for this opportunity to outline the proposed change in this bill before the House.</seg>
<seg id="941">I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have.</seg>
<seg id="942">Does the Chair of the Standing Committee on Legislation have opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="943">Mr. Tom Sammurtok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) As Chair of the Standing Committee on Legislation, I am pleased to make opening comments as the Committee of the Whole begins its consideration of Bill 30, An Act to Amend the Fire Prevention Act.</seg>
<seg id="944">As members will recall, Bill 30 received second reading on November 8, 2016 and was referred to the Standing Committee on Legislation for consideration.</seg>
<seg id="945">The standing committee supports the intent of Bill 30, An Act to Amend the Fire Prevention Act.</seg>
<seg id="946">During the minister’s recent appearance before the standing committee on the occasion of its clause-by-clause consideration of Bill 30, An Act to Amend the Fire Prevention Act, a total of two motions were moved to amend the bill.</seg>
<seg id="947">One of the amendments provides for a public right of access to copies of municipal fire protection plans on a similar basis to that which presently exists under the Emergency Measures Act regarding public access to copies of municipal emergency management programs.</seg>
<seg id="948">The other amendment clarifies a reference in Bill 30 to a provision of the Building Code Act.</seg>
<seg id="949">Bill 30, An Act to Amend the Fire Prevention Act, establishes a number of new responsibilities on the part of municipalities and the Office of the Fire Marshal.</seg>
<seg id="950">The standing committee looks forward to future annual reports of the fire marshal accounting in detail for progress made in fulfilling these responsibilities, including the development of municipal fire protection plans.</seg>
<seg id="951">The standing committee also notes that subsection 23(3)(d) of the Building Code Act provides for a representative of the Office of the Fire Marshal to sit on the Nunavut Building Advisory Committee.</seg>
<seg id="952">The standing committee looks forward to the tabling of the first annual report on the activities of this entity.</seg>
<seg id="953">The approach to the development of municipal fire protection plans that is provided for in Bill 30, An Act to Amend the Fire Prevention Act, is similar to that which is provided for in section 6 of the Emergency Measures Act with respect to the development of municipal emergency management programs</seg>
<seg id="954">However, although the Emergency Measures Act received assent on November 8, 2007, sections 5 to 9 of the statute still have not yet been brought into force, almost a decade after the statute was passed by the Second Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="955">From its dialogue with the minister, the standing committee has been advised that the government hopes to complete this process within 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="956">The standing committee also has been advised that the government intends to bring those provisions of Bill 30 that, and I quote, “pertain to municipal fire protection plans” into force “no later than June of 2018.”</seg>
<seg id="957">Consequently municipalities would have six months in which to make and submit their fire protection plans by January of 2019.</seg>
<seg id="958">The standing committee appreciates the department’s commitment to working closely with the Nunavut Association of Municipalities and the Nunavut Association of Municipal Administrators regarding municipal compliance in this area.</seg>
<seg id="959">Section 1.1 of the current Fire Prevention Act provides that the legislation binds the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="960">However, the extent to which the Office of the Fire Marshal has the jurisdiction to conduct inspections and issue decisions and orders in relation to buildings and other physical structures under the control of the federal government within the territory of Nunavut is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="961">The standing committee recognizes the jurisdictional complexities in this area.</seg>
<seg id="962">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="963">The standing committee recommends the passage of Bill 30, as amended and reprinted, to all members. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">Are there any general comments on the opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="965">If there are none, please refer to Bill 30 in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="966">We will begin the clause-by-clause review of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="967">I have the English copy, so I’ll be reading it in English.</seg>
<seg id="968">Please indicate if you have any questions or comments. (interpretation ends) Bill 30.</seg>
<seg id="969">Reprint.</seg>
<seg id="970">An Act to Amend the Fire Prevention Act. (interpretation) Clause 1.</seg>
<seg id="971">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 3.</seg>
<seg id="972">I just have one question under this about municipalities to maintain the fire protection plan.</seg>
<seg id="973">I’m wondering if the minister can tell us how aware are the municipalities about this amendment and how prepared are they, and perhaps if he can give us some more information on where communities stand today when it comes to a fire protection plan, if they have any at all.</seg>
<seg id="974">The municipalities have been informed twice through NAM meetings.</seg>
<seg id="975">The fire prevention plan will be a template that is offered to the municipalities where they, in certain areas, fill in the blanks for the stuff that they have and then fine-tune it to their own municipality.</seg>
<seg id="976">We will be helping them out with that.</seg>
<seg id="977">We will go back. Bill 30.</seg>
<seg id="978">I will continue where I left off.</seg>
<seg id="979">Clause 5.</seg>
<seg id="980">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 6.</seg>
<seg id="981">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 7.</seg>
<seg id="982">With respect to the assistant fire marshal that would be in the community, it says, “Review of orders by Assistant Fire Marshal or local assistant.”</seg>
<seg id="983">Who would be the local assistant? There are many communities. Can you explain this?</seg>
<seg id="984">I don’t quite understand the question. If he can rephrase it for me, please.</seg>
<seg id="985">Mr. Mikkungwak, can you rephrase the question?</seg>
<seg id="986">I’m referring to the local assistant.</seg>
<seg id="987">Who would that be, seeing that we have 25 communities within the territory?</seg>
<seg id="988">Can he identify who that local assistant would be and duties and powers, and how long they would attain those powers?</seg>
<seg id="989">Minister Savikataaq, do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="990">I thank the member for clarifying.</seg>
<seg id="991">This section would be rarely used, there being quite extraordinary circumstances. It’s where the fire marshal can ask for assistance from someone while they’re doing an investigation or other matters just in the short term, if there is no one there and it was just pertaining to whatever issue he is dealing with at the moment in that community.</seg>
<seg id="992">Who would this local assistant that you have identified in the document be?</seg>
<seg id="993">What position or who would that be? A by-law officer or a maintenance man from CGS?</seg>
<seg id="994">Can he identify who that local assistant would be in the respective communities?</seg>
<seg id="995">This person will be whoever the fire marshal identifies as a qualified person to help.</seg>
<seg id="996">It could be the by-law.</seg>
<seg id="997">It could be the fire chief.</seg>
<seg id="998">It could be one of the fire departments.</seg>
<seg id="999">It would be anyone who the fire marshal deemed would fill the need to be his local assistant.</seg>
<seg id="1000">I’ll continue from where I left off on Bill 30.</seg>

<seg id="1012">Minister Savikataaq, if you have any closing remarks, I give you the opportunity to make them.</seg>
<seg id="1013">I would like to thank all of my staff again for working on this legislation and all the members again for reading all the details.</seg>
<seg id="1014">Now we can, like I said, have a better, safer living and working environment again in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1015">We will proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1016">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the minister’s officials out.</seg>
<seg id="1017">We will proceed to Bill 38 with the Department of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you can get Bill 38 ready.</seg>
<seg id="1019">Minister Ell-Kanayuk, welcome.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Let me first ask if you want officials to join you at the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Bill 38 – Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Implementation Act – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Minister Ell-Kanayuk would like to have her officials join her at the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Minister Ell-Kanayuk, for the record, please introduce your witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="1025">To my right is the (interpretation ends) executive director of the NNI Secretariat (interpretation) and to my left is (interpretation ends) Legal Counsel Thomas Ahlfors. (interpretation) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1026">Mr. Ahlfors, welcome.</seg>
<seg id="1027">Minister Ell-Kanayuk, who is the (interpretation ends) executive director (interpretation) of NNI?</seg>
<seg id="1028">You didn’t say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1029">I’m sorry for not saying his name. He’s Ron Dewar.</seg>
<seg id="1030">Mr. Dewar, welcome to the House.</seg>
<seg id="1031">We will now be reviewing Bill 38.</seg>
<seg id="1032">Minister Ell-Kanayuk, if you have any opening comments, I now give you the floor.</seg>
<seg id="1033">On February 21, 2017 Bill 38, the Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Implementation Act, received first reading, and I was pleased to review this bill with the Standing Committee on Legislation on March 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1034">(interpretation ends) This bill provides the necessary support for the new NNI Policy by providing legal authority to specific provisions, a regulation-making power to make the NNI Policy binding, as well as clarity on certain matters where there may be a conflict with other GN legislation.</seg>
<seg id="1035">This bill also recognizes and empowers the bodies created by the policy, namely, the tribunal and the review committee.</seg>
<seg id="1036">As my colleagues are aware, there have been concerns raised regarding the binding nature of NNI Tribunal recommendations under the new NNI Policy.</seg>
<seg id="1037">This legislation provides the NNI Tribunal with more authority, which will further ensure compliance by government contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1038">This bill is necessary because we have determined that there are provisions in the NNI Policy that should be supported through legislation and not simply through policy or even through changes to regulations under the Financial Administration Act.</seg>
<seg id="1039">In fulfilling our obligations under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, the new NNI Policy was developed collaboratively with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This collaborative process allows the parties to address overarching concerns about the NNI Policy and its intended benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1041">We have also consulted with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated throughout this legislative project to ensure that our intent was fully understood.</seg>
<seg id="1042">This legislation demonstrates to Nunavummiut and to the business community our government’s strong commitment to implementing Article 24 of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement by ensuring proper and full implementation of the new NNI Policy.</seg>
<seg id="1043">It should be emphasized that the proposed NNI Implementation Act does not introduce any provisions that are not currently in the new NNI Policy.</seg>
<seg id="1044">As members will recall, the new NNI Policy is set to come into force on April 1, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1045">It is our hope that Bill 38 can be passed before the coming into force of the new NNI Policy to ensure that the policy’s provisions have the necessary legal authority.</seg>
<seg id="1046">I have invited officials from my department as well as the Department of Justice to assist me today.</seg>
<seg id="1047">I look forward to the committee’s questions and comments regarding Bill 38, the Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Implementation Act. (interpretation) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Does the Chair of the Legislation Committee have opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="1049">Mr. Tom Sammurtok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) As Chair of the Standing Committee on Legislation, I am pleased to make some brief opening comments as the Committee of the Whole begins its consideration of Bill 38, the proposed Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Implementation Act.</seg>
<seg id="1050">As members will recall, Bill 38 received second reading on February 22, 2017 and was referred to the Standing Committee on Legislation for consideration.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The standing committee recognizes that the new NNI Policy was agreed to by both the Government of Nunavut and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and is scheduled to come into effect on April 1, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1052">The standing committee further recognizes that Bill 38 does not change any of the provisions in the new NNI Policy itself.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments. The standing committee recommends the passage of Bill 38 to all members. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">Are there any general comments on the opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="1055">If there are none, please refer to Bill 38 in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="1056">I have the English copy, so I will read it in English. (interpretation ends) Bill 38, Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Implementation Act. (interpretation) Clause 1.</seg>
<seg id="1057">I have a couple of questions here.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Knowing full well that there are a number of contracts that are currently in place that are set for a number of years, would those contracts be affected once this legislation is passed?</seg>
<seg id="1059">This will not affect any contracts that are already in place.</seg>
<seg id="1060">It’s for new contracts after April 1.</seg>
<seg id="1061">Would the businesses that are within the territory of Nunavut that currently hold contracts be notified of possible amendments that may be foreseen or would that be left to the negotiations?</seg>
<seg id="1062">There will be no amendments to any current contracts that the GN holds.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I’ll go back to where I left off. (interpretation ends) Bill 38. (interpretation) Clause 1.</seg>
<seg id="1064">I have a motion that I would like to move. This is a minor housekeeping matter to fix a drafting error in the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1065">Specifically there is an error in a reference to a paragraph of the Financial Administration Act that needs to be corrected. I would like to emphasize that there is no substance to this change.</seg>
<seg id="1066">I thank my colleagues for their understanding.</seg>
<seg id="1067">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Minister Ell-Kanayuk. (interpretation) The motion is in order.</seg>
<seg id="1068">Members, the motion is in your motions binder.</seg>
<seg id="1069">To the motion.</seg>
<seg id="1070">I’m sorry, Minister Ell-Kanayuk, and I’m sorry, my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="1071">Let’s go back.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I obviously have the discretion as the Chair.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Minister Ell-Kanayuk, can you read your motion?</seg>
<seg id="1074">Committee Motion 016 – 4(3): Bill 38, Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Implementation Act, Clause 1 Amendment (Ell-Kanayuk)</seg>
<seg id="1075">I move that paragraph 1(b) is amended by striking out “107(f)” and substituting “107(1)(f).”</seg>
<seg id="1076">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Let’s try again.</seg>
<seg id="1078">Members, you can refer to the motion in your motions binder.</seg>
<seg id="1079">To the motion.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Clause 1, as amended.</seg>
<seg id="1081">Let me proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1082">Clause 2.</seg>
<seg id="1083">I was wondering if the minister can tell us, when it comes to the tribunal and appointments to sit on the tribunal and in fact the review committee, whether or not the business representatives of Nunavut will be taken into consideration to make sure that at least somebody from the business sector sits on either the tribunal or the review committee.</seg>
<seg id="1084">The NNI Tribunal will be comprised of five members and they will be an independent tribunal. We will be appointing two of the five members from the list of nominees that will be provided and three will be appointed by the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The GN and NTI will be free to select the individuals who have demonstrated background in business and have knowledge of economic realities in Nunavut, training and/or experience in procurement law, procurement practices, and government contracting.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The answer to that question is yes, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="1088">How long would the term be for the five appointed members?</seg>
<seg id="1089">Members of the tribunal will have a term of three years.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Are these members who are appointed for this three-year term able to resubmit their application to continue their representation on the NNI Tribunal?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Yes, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1093">With regard to the appointments representing all of Nunavut in this role of the NNI Tribunal, what happens when a party complains about the appointment?</seg>
<seg id="1094">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): I apologize, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1096">I have no idea of the usage of the term “complaint” and f the person wants to be the chair and somebody complains.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Perhaps I am off on a tangent here.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Mr. Mikkungwak, please clarify your question.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1100">That was unfortunately misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="1101">When any business submits an appeal for any contract they may have lost out on, does the businessperson have the ability to appeal that decision based on the appointee’s background or the fact that they are not representing all of Nunavut, as they have to review appeals for all of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1102">As I understand, these tribunal members have to have awareness of the whole territory of Nunavut, otherwise it would seem like a harried response based on a frivolous appeal, as this language seems to indicate that any business appealing a contract has that right. Does this also apply to the various government contract RFP advertisements that are quite numerous, and will this apply to every single contract that this tribunal will oversee?</seg>
<seg id="1103">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Yes, they will be representing all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1104">I just want to ask if the minister can clarify once again in regard to appointments, how many appointments the GN makes and how many appointments the federal government makes and NTI makes.</seg>
<seg id="1105">I wasn’t quite clear. Maybe you can just clarify exactly who is making the appointments and how many.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Minister Ell-Kanayuk, can you clarify that again?</seg>
<seg id="1107">Two will be appointed by Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and three by the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1109">I will go back to Bill 38 and I will start from where I left off.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Clause 2.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 3.</seg>
<seg id="1112">On 5(d) as well as 5(e) there is wording in there that says “preferential treatment.”</seg>
<seg id="1113">I just need to see what that explanation means. What do they mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="1114">I’ll have Ron Dewar explain that.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Chairman: Mr. Dewar, please.</seg>
<seg id="1116">Mr. Dewar: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1117">The preferential treatment is the bid adjustment formula that’s built into the policy for Inuit firms.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I will go back to where I left off.</seg>
<seg id="1119">Bill 38.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Clause 5.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 8.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Members, do you agree to Bill 38 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="1123">Chairman (interpretation): Members, pursuant to Rule 62(2), do you agree that Bill 38, as amended, can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="1124">Minister Ell-Kanayuk, if you have any closing comments, you have the floor.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I would like to thank the NNI Secretariat, Ron Dewar and Allen Kunuk, who is here as the intern for executive director of the NNI Secretariat, for having worked diligently on both the NNI Policy and the NNI Implementation Act, and also the Department of Justice for their work in contributing to the drafting of the Act.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Before we proceed, we will take a 15-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before we take a break, Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses out.</seg>
<seg id="1129">We will take a 15-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1130">>>Committee recessed at 17:32 and resumed at 17:47</seg>
<seg id="1131">Bill 41 – An Act to Amend Certain Acts Respecting Annual Reports Provided to the Speaker – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="1132">Chairman (interpretation): We can now proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1133">We will now be working with the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1134">I would first like to ask the Speaker if he would like to have any witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Speaker (interpretation): Yes, I have witnesses that I would like to bring to the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="1136">The Speaker would like his officials at the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Speaker, we will be dealing with Bill 41. If you have any opening comments, you now have the floor.</seg>
<seg id="1139">I will be speaking in English, as my documents are in English.</seg>
<seg id="1140">I am pleased to have the opportunity to appear today before the Committee of the Whole on the occasion of its consideration of Bill 41, An Act to Amend Certain Acts Respecting Annual Reports Provided to the Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1141">As members are aware, the Legislative Assembly recommends the appointment of five independent officers: the Chief Electoral Officer, the Information and Privacy Commissioner, the Integrity Commissioner, the Languages Commissioner, and the Representative for Children and Youth.</seg>
<seg id="1142">All of these office-holders report to the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1143">Each office-holder’s enabling legislation requires that an annual report on his or her activities be submitted to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly for tabling in the House.</seg>
<seg id="1144">As members are very much aware, a number of these reports are the subject of televised hearings each year on the part of standing committees of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1145">At present there is significant inconsistency with respect to statutory reporting deadlines for annual reports of independent officers.</seg>
<seg id="1146">For example, section 68 of the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act requires the Information and Privacy Commissioner to submit an annual report “by July 1 in each year,” which is only 90 days after the end of the previous fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1147">By contrast, section 24 of the Official Languages Act requires the Languages Commissioner to submit an annual report “within twelve months after the end of each fiscal year.”</seg>
<seg id="1148">The purpose of Bill 41 is to create uniform reporting deadlines for the annual reports of our independent officers, which will achieve significantly greater consistency and predictability.</seg>
<seg id="1149">All independent officers will be required to submit their annual reports to my office within six months after the end of each fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1150">This is a reasonable time frame in which to produce a comprehensive annual report and it is a time frame which will allow for the annual reports to all be tabled in the House during its fall sitting.</seg>
<seg id="1151">I would also note that the Management and Services Board has aimed to help facilitate the timely preparation and submission of such annual reports by providing assurances to all independent officers that the board emphasizes the importance of the information contained in such annual reports, and does not expect them to incur significant expenditures of time and resources with respect to extraneous physical production features.</seg>
<seg id="1152">Bill 41 contains additional provisions regarding the chief electoral officer’s separate reports on the conduct of elections, by-elections, and plebiscites.</seg>
<seg id="1153">At present section 23 of the Inuit Language Protection Act requires that the annual reports of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit (Inuit Language Authority) be submitted to both the Minister of Languages and the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly prior to being tabled in the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Given that the members of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit are appointed on the recommendation of the minister, it is more appropriate for the minister to be solely accountable for receiving and tabling these annual reports.</seg>
<seg id="1155">Bill 41 amends this section of the statute to provide for a clear line of accountability.</seg>
<seg id="1156">I would also note that Bill 41 does not affect the ability of independent officers to submit special reports on matters of concern to the Legislative Assembly at other times.</seg>
<seg id="1157">For example, as members will recall, the Information and Privacy Commissioner recently produced a special report on her office’s privacy audit of the Qikiqtani General Hospital, which I tabled in the House on November 8, 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1158">I look forward to responding to any comments or questions that my colleagues may have. (interpretation) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1159">Are there any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="1160">If there are none, are there any questions to the opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="1161">If there is none, please refer to Bill 41 in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="1162">We will be reviewing it clause by clause.</seg>
<seg id="1163">I believe you all have a copy in front of you.</seg>
<seg id="1164">I have an English copy, so I’ll read it in English. (interpretation ends) Bill 41, An Act to Amend Certain Acts Respecting Annual Reports Provided to the Speaker. (interpretation) Clause 1. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="1165">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 2.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 3.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 4.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 5.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 6.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 7. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="1171">Does the committee agree to Bill 41 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="1172">Pursuant to Rule 62(2), do members agree that Bill 41 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="1173">Mr. Speaker, if you have any closing remarks, I now give you the opportunity to make them.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Speaker (interpretation): I thank you all. I would also like to thank all the staff at the Legislative Assembly. I thank all of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="1175">Bill 43 – An Act to Amend the Legislative Assembly and Executive Council Act – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="1176">Mr. Speaker, we would like to deal with Bill 43. If you have any opening comments on Bill 43, I now give you the opportunity to make them.</seg>
<seg id="1177">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My apologies.</seg>
<seg id="1178">I was just following your lead.</seg>
<seg id="1179">(interpretation) I am pleased to have the opportunity to provide some brief opening comments concerning Bill 43, An Act to Amend the Legislative Assembly and Executive Council Act.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Bill 43 amends Schedule C of the Legislative Assembly and Executive Council Act to change the indemnities and allowances payable to members.</seg>
<seg id="1181">These changes reflect the recent signing of a new collective agreement between the Government of Nunavut and the Nunavut Employees Union.</seg>
<seg id="1182">The base rate of pay for Members of the Legislative Assembly will be increased by the same percentage as that which has been agreed to for members of the Nunavut Employees Union.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments. I look forward to responding to any comments or questions that my colleagues may have. (interpretation) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are there any general comments or questions on the opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="1185">If there are none, please refer to the Bill 43 in your legislation binder. I believe you all have a copy of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1186">I have an English copy in front of me, so I’ll read it in English. (interpretation ends) Bill 43, An Act to Amend the Legislative Assembly and Executive Council Act. (interpretation) Clause 1. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="1187">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 2.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 3.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. Does the committee agree to Bill 43 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="1190">Chairman (interpretation): Pursuant to Rule 62(2), do members agree that Bill 43 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="1191">Mr. Speaker, if you have any closing remarks, I give you the opportunity to make them.</seg>
<seg id="1192">I will just express my gratitude to our officials for their dedication on the completion of this work and the successful completion of our session. I thank each and every one of you.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the Speaker’s official out.</seg>
<seg id="1194">What is the wish of the committee?</seg>
<seg id="1195">It has been a long day for some of us. Mr. Speaker, we have completed the wish of the committee, therefore I would like to report progress.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1197">There is a motion on the floor to report progress and the motion is not debatable.</seg>
<seg id="1198">All those in favour of the motion, raise your hand.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The motion is carried and I will now rise to report progress to the Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1200">Item 20.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Mr. Enook (interpretation): Mr. Speaker, your committee has been considering Bills 26, 28, 30, 38, 41, and 43 and would like to report that Bills 26, 28, 30, 41, and 43 can immediately be read for the third time, that Bill 38 can now immediately be read as amended, and that one committee motion was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Speaker (interpretation): There’s a motion on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="1203">(interpretation ends) Thank you, members.</seg>
<seg id="1204">I wish to advise the House that I have received written notice under Rule 20(2) that the Member for Cambridge Bay intends to raise a matter of personal privilege under this rule.</seg>
<seg id="1205">I now recognize the Member for Cambridge Bay. Mr. Peterson, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1206">I rise today pursuant to Rule 20(1) on a personal matter where I would like to correct published accusations against myself.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Mr. Speaker, as elected officials and especially as cabinet ministers, we are scrutinized by the public and media quite a bit.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Over time we learn to develop a pretty thick skin and just roll with the punches that are thrown at us as we go about our duties serving the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1209">However, there comes a time when enough is enough.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Mr. Speaker, the media publishes a lot of stories that single out the work I do as a cabinet minister in this government. For the most part I live with facts that are published.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Saying that, I feel I must address a recent story reported by Kent Driscoll which I saw on APTN’s national news website on March 9 entitled, and I quote, “Former Nunavut Premier asking why a report on RCMP being kept secret.”</seg>
<seg id="1212">There are three statements that I believe are incorrect in the interview that misquote myself and could effectively and recklessly misinform the public.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In the video Mr. Driscoll states, and I quote, “The Government of Nunavut commissioned a report into civilian oversight of the RCMP.”</seg>
<seg id="1214">Mr. Speaker, neither myself nor the Government of Nunavut have commissioned a report into civilian oversight of the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1215">I believe I clearly stated in both the October 18, 2016 and March 2017 Hansard that I have asked my justice officials to review what other jurisdictions do across Canada as it relates to oversight of police forces.</seg>
<seg id="1216">In the written summary of the story on APTN’s website, Mr. Driscoll writes, and I quote, “The report investigated civilian oversight of the RCMP across Canada, and how that could work in Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="1217">Again, there is no report and we did not investigate civilian oversight of the RCMP across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Mr. Driscoll singles out the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1219">My request to my staff was to review what other jurisdictions in Canada are doing for policing oversight.</seg>
<seg id="1220">Again, I believe that is clearly stated in the Hansard.</seg>
<seg id="1221">A misconception might have occurred when I responded to questions on March 2 saying, and I quote, “It’s not a report I’m going to make public, but it’s an internal report…”</seg>
<seg id="1222">Mr. Speaker, in the context of the discussion I was referring to, I asked my staff to gather information for me on what other jurisdictions in Canada do in relation to police oversight.</seg>
<seg id="1223">That is all, Mr. Speaker, gather information by calling other provincial and territorial jurisdictions and do some basic Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Furthermore, Mr. Driscoll states, and I quote, “Okalik requested the review of civilian oversight of the RCMP in 2016, after a high profile incident in Iqaluit’s cells.”</seg>
<seg id="1225">Mr. Speaker, I reviewed the Hansard from when Mr. Okalik questioned me on October 18, 2016 and nowhere do I see where Mr. Okalik requested a review of civilian oversight of the RCMP. He does ask me if I, and I quote, “support the establishment of a civilian oversight body here in Nunavut, yes or no?”</seg>
<seg id="1226">It is pretty clear in our exchange that I did ask my justice officials to look at what other jurisdictions in Canada were doing in relation to police oversight.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Moreover Mr. Okalik was referring to civilian oversight relating to comments from an Ottawa Police Service member on social media and not specifically to incidents in RCMP cells, as the story indicates.</seg>
<seg id="1228">It concerns me that the reporter tried to make it seem that I have commissioned a report into the civilian oversight of the RCMP. This is clearly not true if you research and review Hansard.</seg>
<seg id="1229">I would like the RCMP to be rest assured that the Government of Nunavut values the dedicated and often dangerous work that the members of the RCMP do to protect our citizens and our communities across our great territory.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Mr. Speaker, the discussion of civilian oversight and the investigation of serious incidents involving the RCMP and Nunavut is a complicated one which began last spring.</seg>
<seg id="1231">It still requires a great deal of work.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Indeed, in the shared directional statement I signed with the RCMP which was tabled in the legislature in November of 2016, we made a shared commitment to address this issue, stating that, and I quote, “The GN and RCMP agree that allegations of police misconduct must be taken seriously and acted upon.”</seg>
<seg id="1233">Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by stating that I have the utmost respect for the men and women of the RCMP who protect our communities.</seg>
<seg id="1234">They are part of our communities, their children attend school with our children, they participate in special events, and give of their time volunteering in our communities. For that I am very thankful.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I hope this clears up the misconception that this story has created.</seg>
<seg id="1236">As Rule 20 requires no action from the Chair or the House, the matter is closed and we will proceed to the next item on the orders of the day.</seg>

<seg id="148">However, I am certain that none of these graduates will regret making the sacrifices that they did.</seg>
<seg id="149">They have each worked hard to receive their diplomas and, in doing so, have demonstrated their undeniable commitment and abilities to future employers.</seg>

<seg id="178">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask all members to join me in celebrating the recent grand opening of Kimmirut’s new community wellness centre.</seg>
<seg id="179">Mr. Speaker, in late March of this year I had the honour of joining with Commissioner Nellie Kusugak and a significant number of my constituents on the occasion of the new facility’s opening on March 31.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, the Kimmirut Wellness Centre is an excellent example of the progress that can be made when different levels of government work together for a common purpose.</seg>
<seg id="181">In this case the Municipality of Kimmirut arranged for a staff housing unit to be renovated and repurposed for use as the community’s new wellness centre.</seg>
<seg id="182">Mr. Speaker, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the vision of the community’s local leadership in making this possible.</seg>
<seg id="183">The Department of Family Services and the Department of Health have provided essential financial support towards the opening of the centre, and I thank both ministers for their support.</seg>
<seg id="184">Mr. Speaker, the wellness centre will provide space in which much-needed programming can be delivered to community residents.</seg>
<seg id="185">I look forward to the centre’s ongoing success, and I ask all members to join me marking this milestone.</seg>

<seg id="208">Have a good day.</seg>
<seg id="209">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the students who went to Stratford, Ontario from May 15 to 22.</seg>
<seg id="210">There were 12 students from Pangnirtung. The students and their chaperones had said how well they were taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="211">There were student exchanges from Stratford and Pangnirtung. The students from Pangnirtung were:</seg>
<seg id="212">Elisapee Maniapik,</seg>
<seg id="213">Adam Mike,</seg>
<seg id="214">Susa Angnakak,</seg>
<seg id="215">Susan Kilabuk,</seg>
<seg id="216">Susie Qaqqasiq Dialla,</seg>
<seg id="217">Benjamin Qaqqasiq,</seg>
<seg id="218">Isaac Dialla,</seg>
<seg id="219">Ida Etuangat,</seg>
<seg id="220">Saila Kakee,</seg>
<seg id="221">Wayne Michael,</seg>
<seg id="222">Michael Alivaktuk, and</seg>
<seg id="223">Maggie Alivaktuk</seg>
<seg id="224">The chaperones were Mary Rose Kilabuk, Barrett Mason, and Kayla Rice.</seg>
<seg id="225">They are from Attagoyuk School in Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="226">I would like to express my pride in them for being able to participate in the exchange with Stratford, Ontario.</seg>
<seg id="227">Member’s Statement 552 – 4(3): Arviat Fishing Derby (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="228">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I say “good day” to the residents of Arviat.</seg>
<seg id="229">Before I begin, my granddaughter June Naujaat Savikataaq celebrated her birthday yesterday. Happy birthday, granddaughter. I hope you have a good day.</seg>
<seg id="230">I would also like to celebrate with the people who just finished a fishing derby in Arviat.</seg>
<seg id="231">There was a trout fishing derby and I would also like to congratulate the winner of the fishing derby. After that there was a cod fishing derby and I celebrate with the winners.</seg>
<seg id="232">It was very enjoyable. Although it was pretty cold, it was very enjoyable during the fishing derby when the families went out.</seg>
<seg id="233">Although the last one is not too much of good news, I would also like to send my condolences to the people who have lost a loved one in Arviat.</seg>
<seg id="234">Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="235">Member’s Statement 553 – 4(3): Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Tapestry (Taptuna)</seg>
<seg id="236">Good afternoon, my colleagues, Nunavummiut, and Kuglukturmiut.</seg>
<seg id="237">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the women who have been sewing a tapestry in Kugluktuk in recognition of the missing and murdered indigenous women.</seg>
<seg id="238">Our representative on that commission travelled to take part in this inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="239">They are trying to determine what happened to their loved ones who have disappeared or who have been murdered.</seg>
<seg id="240">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, in my hometown of Kugluktuk local volunteers, including the former commissioner, Edna Elias, had the idea of making a tapestry. Edna reached out to the community of Kugluktuk with the idea and the response from our community was immediate and strong. Sixteen people joined together to begin the work on a tapestry.</seg>
<seg id="241">Mr. Speaker, the tapestry honours the women who have been murdered or are missing from Kugluktuk. The people who worked on the tapestry kept the missing and murdered individuals in their minds as they diligently completed the project.</seg>
<seg id="242">The tapestry was given to the RCMP officer who was posted in Kugluktuk and now is working for the missing and murdered indigenous women inquiry in Ottawa. The tapestry makers believe that the officers will have this as a reminder of the people and their families who are looking for answers as the inquiry begins.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, join me as we thank the people of Kugluktuk who worked on the tapestry and remember all Nunavummiut and their families that have been affected by this.</seg>
<seg id="244">Member for Arviat and Whale Cove, Mr. George Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="245">Member’s Statement 554 – 4(3): Winners of Recent Fishing Derby in Arviat (Kuksuk)</seg>
<seg id="246">I say “good afternoon” to my fellow Nunavummiut and my fellow residents of Arviat and the people of Whale Cove. It’s good to see my colleagues again as we begin our two-week session.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, before I make my statement, I feel the same way as my colleagues who have lost a loved one and I send my condolences to the people in Arviat who have lost a loved one. I know that they’re not my relatives, but we do feel for our fellow residents when they lose a loved one, so I send my condolences to the family.</seg>
<seg id="248">That’s the first thing I wanted to say.</seg>
<seg id="249">There were fishing derbies in a majority of the communities in Nunavut. There was also a fishing derby in Arviat and they have a committee for a trout and pike fishing derby. I was asked by the committee if I could take part in the prize-giving ceremony and so I did.</seg>
<seg id="250">I was very happy to take part and seeing big, huge lake trout and pike. One of the pictures is in my binder where you will be able to see the size of the fish.</seg>
<seg id="251">I’m sure you have seen pictures in the media of families who were very happy to go out on the land and go out as a family to these fishing derbies. When things go well during a fishing derby, we are very glad.</seg>
<seg id="252">Next year we are looking forward to other fishing derbies and in upcoming years.</seg>
<seg id="253">I would like to thank the people of Arviat and Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="254">Member for Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu, Ms. Pat Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="255">Before I recognize this individual, I would first like to say that I’m thinking of my husband and our relatives in Pangnirtung. I know that they’re going through a difficult time now and I send my love.</seg>
<seg id="256">I am very pleased to have this opportunity to recognize a number of visitors in the gallery today who have joined us from the Parliamentary Internship Program of the House of Commons.</seg>
<seg id="257">These young Canadians are currently working in the offices of Members of Parliament. They are in Nunavut this week for their program’s annual study tour.</seg>
<seg id="258">I had the opportunity to meet with the group on Sunday for some round-table discussions, and I was very impressed by their questions.</seg>
<seg id="259">It was a little hard for me.</seg>
<seg id="260">I would like you to please join me in welcoming the following individuals, and I promise to try to say your names correctly. I would like you to stand up when I call your name. They’re on both sides of the House today.</seg>
<seg id="261">Matthew Blackshaw;</seg>
<seg id="262">Alec Boudreau;</seg>
<seg id="263">Jeanette Carney;</seg>
<seg id="264">Michael Forestell;</seg>
<seg id="265">Astrid Krizus;</seg>
<seg id="266">Skeena Lawson;</seg>
<seg id="267">Josh Regnier;</seg>
<seg id="268">Anna Rotman;</seg>
<seg id="269">Claire Sieffert; and</seg>
<seg id="270">Ryan van den Berg.</seg>
<seg id="271">I would also like to take this time to recognize two other constituents I have in the House.</seg>
<seg id="272">Mr. Qajaaq Ellsworth is here with us today. Welcome. Also I would like to welcome Mr. Pitseolak Pfeifer, who is with us today.</seg>
<seg id="273">Mr. Pfeifer is currently enrolled in a master’s program at Carleton University and is back home for the summer, where he will be kept busy working at the Nunavut [Research] Institute as a summer student under the mentorship of Mary Ellen Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="274">Member for Arviat and Whale Cove, Mr. George Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="275">Hon. George Kuksuk (interpretation): Thank you again, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="276">Today I would like to recognize and welcome to the House visitors in the gallery, but I’ll first talk about a funny story.</seg>
<seg id="277">I received a letter from the people I will be recognizing.</seg>
<seg id="278">They had asked me a while ago that if I had the opportunity, they wanted to join me for breakfast and have a meeting as they will be in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="279">As I read the letter and saw where it came from, I did a double take and it was from David Johnston. I automatically thought that the letter came from the Governor General.</seg>
<seg id="280">I was very pleased and honoured that I’m going to have breakfast with him.</seg>
<seg id="281">When I saw the letter again and reread it carefully to confirm if it was really him, it turns out there’s another David Johnston, although he also holds a high position.</seg>
<seg id="282">I would like you to know that, my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="283">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, good afternoon again.</seg>
<seg id="284">Today I would like to recognize in the gallery a couple of individuals that are present here today.</seg>
<seg id="285">They are special guests from the national office of the official languages commissioner, the office of the national commissioner in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="286">Here that I would like to recognize today are starting with… . Maybe you can stand up when I say your name. Ms. Mary Donaghy is the assistant to the commissioner on policy and communications.</seg>
<seg id="287">Welcome, and Mr. David Johnston…</seg>
<seg id="288">…the commissioner’s representative who represents Quebec and Nunavut. (interpretation) They represent Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="289">(interpretation ends) Welcome to our Legislative Assembly of Nunavut. (interpretation) Welcome. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="290">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) Welcome to the gallery. (interpretation) Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="291">Member for Rankin Inlet and Chesterfield Inlet, Mr. Tom Sammurtok.</seg>
<seg id="292">Question 711 – 4(3): Chesterfield Inlet Airport (Sammurtok, T)</seg>
<seg id="293">My questions are for the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="294">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, last year the minister tabled her department’s Nunavut Airports 20-Year Infrastructure Needs Assessment.</seg>
<seg id="295">This report indicates that Chesterfield Inlet’s airport, and I quote, “requires immediate replacement with a new building” as a consequence of its “failing structural and building system condition.”</seg>
<seg id="296">During our recent winter sitting I asked the minister to indicate where Chesterfield Inlet stands on her department’s capital priority ranking list for airport terminal building replacements.</seg>
<seg id="297">Can she provide an update today on where this project currently stands?</seg>
<seg id="298">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="299">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member.</seg>
<seg id="300">It’s explained in the 20-year capital plan.</seg>
<seg id="301">The 20-year capital plan is not for capital items. (interpretation ends) The 20-year capital plan is a planning process for the economic development and transportation agenda and it’s not projects that are in or we are working to try to put them in a capital plan.</seg>
<seg id="302">At this time Chesterfield Inlet is recognized that it is a priority for the department and that it needs replacement, but at this time there is no further movement.</seg>
<seg id="303">Your first supplementary, Mr. Sammurtok.</seg>
<seg id="304">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="305">She just gave me some more questions to ask in a few days.</seg>
<seg id="306">As the minister will be aware, the Auditor General of Canada recently issued a report on the topic of civil aviation infrastructure in the north.</seg>
<seg id="307">This report indicates, and I quote, “satellite-based navigation has improved the efficiency of air transportation.</seg>
<seg id="308">These navigation systems allow more direct flight paths, and they allow pilots with aircraft appropriately equipped for satellite-based navigation to land aircraft under conditions with lower cloud bases.”</seg>
<seg id="309">However, it is my understanding that Chesterfield Inlet’s airport currently lacks a modern GPS approach, which has a negative impact on the ability of aircraft to land at the airport during certain weather conditions.</seg>
<seg id="310">Can the minister indicate if her department has raised this issue with the appropriate federal authorities?</seg>
<seg id="311">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="312">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="313">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="314">Mr. Speaker, our department works closely with federal authorities and this is one topic where we have been communicating, especially with the Nunavut Airports Division, with the instrumental procedures that the member is talking about.</seg>
<seg id="315">We have identified several runways in Nunavut that need improvements in the navigational/instrumental aids.</seg>
<seg id="316">We are currently working on some and currently addressing others to be worked on.</seg>
<seg id="317">Mr. Tom Sammurtok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) As the minister will recall, the recent federal budget announced, and I quote, “investments will also be made to resolve critical transportation needs in Canada’s north…” Mr. Speaker, that is indeed good news.</seg>
<seg id="318">Can the minister indicate if she has been advised by her federal counterpart as to what specific investments will be made to our transportation infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="319">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="320">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="321">As we know, the budget was just recently announced. The terms and conditions of those funding arrangements are currently being discussed, so I’m not able to say exactly which funding we will have access to, but I believe there are some in there that we will gladly be taking advantage of.</seg>
<seg id="322">Question 712 – 4(3): Carbon Tax (Angnakak)</seg>
<seg id="323">My question was going to be for the Premier, but I have just found out that there has been a change of the minister for this portfolio.</seg>
<seg id="324">My question is for the Minister of Finance, who I understand now has taken over this file, and it concerns the issue of the federal government’s plan for a national carbon tax to be in place for every province and territory by the end of next year.</seg>
<seg id="325">Earlier this month a question was asked in the Senate of Canada on this issue. The government’s representative in the Senate responded by stating, and I quote, “The Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate specifically recognizes the unique challenges faced by Northern and remote communities with respect to pricing carbon pollution, compared to the rest of Canada, including high costs of living and of energy, food security, and emerging economies. (…) As part of this effort, a study to assess the implications of carbon pricing for the territories is expected to be launched this spring and completed in the fall.”</seg>
<seg id="326">Mr. Speaker, summer is just around the corner.</seg>
<seg id="327">Can the minister indicate the extent to which the Government of Nunavut will be participating in this study?</seg>
<seg id="328">I thank Ms. Angnakak for the question.</seg>
<seg id="329">I would expect the Government of Nunavut to be a full and serious partner in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="330">The three territories have been recognized as special circumstances up here. It’s exactly for the reasons you mentioned and it was mentioned in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="331">I don’t have the details of when we’re going to get involved in the study, but I think the study is supposed to be complete by the end of August and we will go from there. I expect we will be full partners in the discussion in how we can move forward on carbon pricing.</seg>
<seg id="332">I’m hoping, with the new minister, that you will be up to date on the file for my next question.</seg>
<seg id="333">During our recent winter sitting of the Legislative Assembly, the Premier’s letter to Agnico Eagle Mines was tabled in the House. In his letter the Premier wrote that the Government of Nunavut is, and I quote, “working on developing a carbon tax that will make sense for Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="334">Can the minister describe what kind of carbon tax would “make sense” for the territory?</seg>
<seg id="335">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Finance, Mr. Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="336">It’s a good question.</seg>
<seg id="337">Again, because of our unique circumstances up here, we’re almost 100 percent dependent on fossil fuels. We don’t have hydro projects and we don’t have much of any alternative energy up here, so we’re 100 dependent on fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="338">When we get into the meetings with our sister territories and the federal government, I’m sure we’re going to have some real, in-depth, hard discussions on how carbon pricing could affect Nunavut and ways to mitigate the potential additional costs on our territory, economy, communities, and government.</seg>
<seg id="339">I’m guessing now, but up to 80 percent of the communities rely on government funding one way or the other through fuel subsidy costs.</seg>
<seg id="340">It’s going to have a huge impact on our government.</seg>
<seg id="341">Of course I know the mining industry is very important to our territory, so we will have to take their concerns and other business as well into consideration and ensure that the Government of Canada understands our circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="342">Thank you for your response, minister.</seg>
<seg id="343">That leads me to my last question.</seg>
<seg id="344">The Government of Canada recently released its Technical Paper on the Federal Carbon Pricing Backstop.</seg>
<seg id="345">In his response to this release, the premier of the NWT noted that the paper did not specifically address the north.</seg>
<seg id="346">Can the minister clarify the extent to which the three northern territories are working together to develop a joint position on the issue of carbon pricing?</seg>
<seg id="347">I can’t clarify to the extent. I know the Premier and his colleagues have had extensive discussions over the last year or year and a half on carbon pricing at their various meetings in detail.</seg>
<seg id="348">It’s one of these situations where an issue of significance to the three territories requires us all to work together.</seg>
<seg id="349">I don’t anticipate that we will go individually to the government. We will be working together and probably establish a common message and arguments to approach the Government of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="350">Question 713 – 4(3): Emergency Measures Act (Akoak)</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="352">As the minister is aware, sections 5 to 9 of the Emergency Measures Act, which was passed in 2007, are still not in force.</seg>
<seg id="353">Once in force, sections 5 to 8 of the Act will require that all departments, public agencies, and municipal corporations to prepare emergency management plans.</seg>
<seg id="354">During our recent winter sitting, members were informed that almost all municipal corporations had completed their emergency management plans.</seg>
<seg id="355">Mr. Speaker, can the minister tell us if all government departments and public agencies have completed emergency management plans?</seg>
<seg id="356">The member is right that almost all communities are done now.</seg>
<seg id="357">There are three communities that do not have it yet, that is, Pangnirtung, Pond Inlet, and Kugaaruk.</seg>
<seg id="358">The training for the two communities in Baffin has been done and the training for Kugaaruk is planned for either the summer or fall of 2017.</seg>
<seg id="359">Once these are done, all of the communities will have their emergency management plans completed and approved.</seg>
<seg id="360">Once in force, section 9 of the Emergency Measures Act will mandate that municipal and departmental emergency management plans “shall be made available to the public for inspection during ordinary business hours at an office of the government institution or municipal corporation.”</seg>
<seg id="361">Can the minister tell us if those emergency management plans that have already been completed are currently being made available for the public to access?</seg>
<seg id="362">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Community and Government Services, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="363">My understanding is yes, the ones that are done would be available for the public to view at their hamlet office.</seg>
<seg id="364">The emergency management plans are a community document. It’s a plan on how the community would act in an emergency and what resources they have to deal with the emergency and where they can get more help if they need be.</seg>
<seg id="365">If any members would like to look at the emergency management plan in their community that is done, my understanding is they can just go to the municipal office and ask to view it.</seg>
<seg id="366">Can the minister tell us if the government plans to bring sections 5 to 9 of the Emergency Measures Act into force before the dissolution of this Legislative Assembly in September?</seg>
<seg id="367">As I stated earlier, the last training session for the last community will be in either late summer or the fall of 2017.</seg>
<seg id="368">We will do our best to make sure that’s completed, but I can’t make any commitments as to whether it will be done or not because we have to arrange for a mutual time for the training to be done for the last community. If it’s done in a timely manner and it gets done, then it will be done.</seg>
<seg id="369">If we have unforeseen circumstances to keep us from getting the training done, then it would have to be delayed, but it will come into force and we plan to have this done as soon as we can.</seg>
<seg id="370">Question 714 – 4(3): Baker Lake Airport (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="371">My questions are for the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="372">Last year the minister tabled her department’s Nunavut Airports 20-Year Infrastructure Needs Assessment.</seg>
<seg id="373">This report indicates that Baker Lake’s airport is one of four airports in the territory that require, and I quote, “substantial upgrades to their existing ATB facilities to address building system faults or major structural items.”</seg>
<seg id="374">On March 24, 2017 the government issued a construction tender for renovations to Baker Lake’s airport terminal building.</seg>
<seg id="375">The tender closed on April 19, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="376">Can the minister confirm if the contract for this tender has been issued and when the work will begin?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="380">The Baker Lake improvements for their airport were tendered not too long ago and who the proponent will be is currently being considered. The announcement will be made this spring.</seg>
<seg id="381">Can the minister indicate approximately how much has been budgeted for the renovation of Baker Lake’s airport terminal building?</seg>
<seg id="382">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="383">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="384">The budget in 2016-17 was for $1,550,000, which some has been carried over.</seg>
<seg id="385">I thank the minister for the response.</seg>
<seg id="386">As the minister will be aware, the Auditor General of Canada recently issued a report on the topic of civil aviation infrastructure in the north.</seg>
<seg id="387">This report indicated that, and I quote, “satellite-based navigation has improved the efficiency of air transportation.</seg>
<seg id="388">These navigation systems allow more direct flight paths, and they allow pilots with aircraft appropriately equipped for satellite-based navigation to land aircraft under conditions with lower cloud bases.”</seg>
<seg id="389">When I last raised the issue of GPS approaches at Baker Lake’s airport during our recent winter sitting, the minister indicated that a report would be provided to me concerning the status of Baker Lake’s airport.</seg>
<seg id="390">Will the minister commit to tabling this report during our current spring sitting?</seg>
<seg id="391">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="392">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="393">I will look into that.</seg>
<seg id="394">Question 715 – 4(3): Pond Inlet Marine Facility (Enook)</seg>
<seg id="395">My questions today are for the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="396">Mr. Speaker, as you will recall from your recent visit to Pond Inlet, the community is very much looking forward to the opening of our new marine facility.</seg>
<seg id="397">My first question for the minister is: can you indicate when the final design of the facility is anticipated to be completed?</seg>
<seg id="398">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="399">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="400">I also thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="401">This project is proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="402">As the member is aware, we’re expecting that the work will proceed in the summer of 2018 with the regulatory bodies. As he indicated, it was discussed openly in Pond Inlet in February 2017.</seg>
<seg id="403">Before their plan could be given to the Nunavut Impact Review Board, they had to do consultations.</seg>
<seg id="404">We expect, as indicated before, it’s proceeding as planned.</seg>
<seg id="405">I don’t think my question was answered.</seg>
<seg id="406">If I wasn’t clear enough, I apologize.</seg>
<seg id="407">I’ll try to ask again. This was discussed in February and the design is probably being finished.</seg>
<seg id="408">Let me ask this question. Once the design is complete, when will the project be submitted to the Nunavut Impact Review Board?</seg>
<seg id="409">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="410">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="411">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="412">The geotechnical and environmental baseline studies are being carried out under a screening decision report that was issued on August 16, 2016 and is intended to cover activities up to September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="413">The NIRB application will be submitted by the end of April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="414">Perhaps once the Hansard is out tomorrow, I’ll ask again.</seg>
<seg id="415">The dates didn’t coincide with each other in the minister’s response.</seg>
<seg id="416">Once the dates are clear tomorrow, I’ll ask about it again.</seg>
<seg id="417">Mr. Speaker, as the minister will recall, the Legislative Assembly voted last fall to approve $2.0 million in the 2017-18 capital estimates towards this project, and I thank all of my colleagues for their support of this critically needed infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="418">I also thank the federal government for its support of the project through the Building Canada Fund.</seg>
<seg id="419">My question for the minister is this: can you indicate approximately how much funding your department will be seeking in the upcoming 2018-19 capital estimates for the Pond Inlet marine facility?</seg>
<seg id="420">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="421">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="422">I also thank the member for asking these questions.</seg>
<seg id="423">All I can say is that money has been budgeted, but it will have to be submitted to the House and it still has to be approved.</seg>
<seg id="424">The project is proceeding well and we will be reviewing it in the House.</seg>
<seg id="425">Question 716 – 4(3): Kimmirut Airport (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="426">My questions today are also for the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="427">Mr. Speaker, during our recent winter sitting the minister informed me that her department is continuing to look at the need to relocate Kimmirut’s airport. As the minister will be aware, this issue was noted in the Auditor General of Canada’s recent report on civil aviation infrastructure in the north.</seg>
<seg id="428">Mr. Speaker, the recent federal budget indicated that, and I quote, “investments will also be made to resolve critical transportation needs in Canada’s north...” I would like to ask the minister if she can indicate if her department will be submitting Kimmirut’s airport relocation as a priority project under this new federal investment plan.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="430">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the Auditor General for his report. It will help us in terms our work for funding from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="431">Also to answer the member’s question, the department will ensure that the relocation of the Kimmirut Airport project receives full consideration under the Government of Nunavut’s capital plan.</seg>
<seg id="432">Sometimes when we’re dealing with federal funds, before we can submit an application for funding, those funds have to be in the capital plan of our own government. Having said that, we will be looking into the details of the current budget to look at and determine how to proceed with applications.</seg>
<seg id="433">I would like to update the member that consultants have been hired to prepare phase 2 of the Kimmirut Airport relocation so that they can do a concept design and cost estimates. That work will be starting in June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="434">Mr. Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the minister for that response.</seg>
<seg id="435">I want to take this opportunity to thank the minister for providing me with copies of recent technical studies that her department commissioned regarding the relocation of Kimmirut’s airport. I also thank you for informing me that phase 2 will commence this summer.</seg>
<seg id="436">Will you be able to table the results of the study in the House during our fall sitting?</seg>
<seg id="437">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="438">I’m not sure if that is something that we do on a regular basis, but I will have the staff look into that possibility.</seg>
<seg id="439">Just to also say that the conceptual design drawings and detailed report will provide us with our class “C” cost estimate and that information will be used to develop a substantiation sheet for consideration in the capital planning process for the 2019-2020 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="440">Your final supplementary, Mr. David Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="441">Can the minister indicate what the approximate cost of relocating Kimmirut’s airport is currently estimated to be?</seg>
<seg id="442">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="443">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="444">Currently I don’t have information of that nature in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="445">Question 717 – 4(3): Funding Transfer Decisions (Sammurtok, A)</seg>
<seg id="446">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Speaker, in March I received notification from the minister that funds had been transferred from the Kivalliq Visitor Centre project to the Grays Bay Road and Port Project.</seg>
<seg id="448">Can the minister provide an update on why the Grays Bay project was prioritized to receive extra funding and what other capital projects may receive funding out of the anticipated surplus from the Kivalliq Visitor Centre project?</seg>
<seg id="449">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="450">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="451">I’m very pleased that a project had surplus and with that minor surplus, my colleagues were able to approve that we could transfer those funds.</seg>
<seg id="452">I’m glad that the minister is pleased and she might be able to transfer some of that funding to my next question.</seg>
<seg id="453">Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues will be well aware, I have lobbied at length for the establishment of an elders’ care facility in Rankin Inlet, either by leasing a facility such as Nanuq Lodge or renovating another facility.</seg>
<seg id="454">Can the minister confirm whether any consideration was given to transfer surplus funds from the Kivalliq Visitor Centre project to a project that will support the establishment of an elders centre in Rankin Inlet?</seg>
<seg id="455">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="456">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="457">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="458">The funding that we request from the federal government are arrangements and there are documents that we have to go by. If there is a surplus of that nature, the funding has to go within the same parameters that we asked for.</seg>
<seg id="459">It is very disappointing that our government will not adjust its capital plan to address needs which have been identified in the Kivalliq region as well as in the Kitikmeot and Baffin regions.</seg>
<seg id="460">Will the minister commit to working with her cabinet colleagues to ensure that surplus funding from her department’s capital projects can be made available for such projects as a Rankin Inlet elders facility?</seg>
<seg id="461">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="463">I thank the member for his persistence.</seg>
<seg id="464">Mr. Speaker, those funds that we are talking about was a small surplus from one infrastructure project and we already discussed what happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="465">At this point I can’t answer the member’s question to any other surplus that may occur in the future.</seg>
<seg id="466">Question 718 – 4(3): Qikiqtarjuaq Marine Infrastructure (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="467">Mr. Keyootak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="468">My questions are for the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="469">I would first like to thank the minister for her recent visit to Qikiqtarjuaq.</seg>
<seg id="470">This was an excellent opportunity for her to meet with local leaders and to see first-hand the need for new marine infrastructure in the community.</seg>
<seg id="471">As the minister will recall, I have raised the issue of marine infrastructure on a number of occasions.</seg>
<seg id="472">Can the minister indicate whether or not her department is working with the municipality to update the proposal for a new marine facility?</seg>
<seg id="473">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank my colleagues for keeping me on the hot seat.</seg>
<seg id="474">(interpretation ends) I made a trip to Qikiqtarjuaq last week where I saw first-hand the community plans for the project to support fisheries, tourism, and other growth industries in his community.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, I could gladly say that I have asked my officials to open discussions with other departments that will need to be involved in this and I look forward to their input.</seg>
<seg id="476">(interpretation) Mr. Speaker, again, I have directed my staff and we are going to have a close working relationship with the hamlet on the marine infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="477">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="478">As the minister is aware from her recent visit to Qikiqtarjuaq, a new marine facility would greatly help the community’s fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="479">The recent federal budget indicated that, and I quote, “To help connect northern communities to trade and investment opportunities, investments will also be made to resolve critical transportation needs in Canada’s north…” Can the minister indicate whether or not marine infrastructure is eligible for funding under this federal initiative?</seg>
<seg id="480">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="481">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member.</seg>
<seg id="482">Looking at the requests from Qikiqtarjuaq and he federal government’s recent announcement that there’s funding available, we have to review all of the details. The federal departments are currently doing a review on the application process.</seg>
<seg id="483">Even if that’s the case, we are going to start working with the community. I would also like to indicate to the member that the Department of Economic Development and Transportation might not be the lead department.</seg>
<seg id="484">It might be either the Department of Environment or another department because it’s mainly for the fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="485">Your final supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="486">I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="487">She already responded to part of my next question, but I would like to ask if the minister can indicate what the next steps are with respect to the Qikiqtarjuaq marine facility.</seg>
<seg id="488">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="489">Near the end of last week we were in Qikiqtarjuaq and we had a first-hand look at the plans for the marine infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="490">I can tell him that I had brought over a large conceptual design to Qikiqtarjuaq and I will make sure that it’s put up in a visible area in my office this week so that my colleagues can see it.</seg>
<seg id="491">My officials have indicated that they are going to work with other departments within the Nunavut government and they’re going to discuss and review the plan, including the request that was made by Qikiqtarjuaq.</seg>
<seg id="492">We have indicated our willingness to help and I have also requested some documents which will be provided to the mayor and the hamlet council to show how our visit to the community was productive.</seg>
<seg id="493">Question 719 – 4(3): NNI Policy (Angnakak)</seg>
<seg id="494">I didn’t want to be the only one not asking the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation a question, so this question is directed to her.</seg>
<seg id="495">As the minister is aware, the government’s new NNI Policy came into effect on April 1, 2017. Section 9 of the new policy provides for the establishment of an NNI Tribunal, which replaces the contracting appeals board under the old NNI Policy.</seg>
<seg id="496">The tribunal is to be composed of five members.</seg>
<seg id="497">Can the minister confirm who has been appointed to serve on the NNI Tribunal?</seg>
<seg id="498">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="499">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="500">At first I thought, because all the members have been asking me questions, I’ll take it as notice, but I think I can answer this one.</seg>
<seg id="501">Appointees to the new NNI Tribunal under the NNI Implementation Act, recent appointments were done and they are Barbara Tartak, Al Lahure, and Sarah Maniapik currently and another appointee who has Canadian International Trade Tribunal experience is James Ogilvie.</seg>
<seg id="502">Section 12 of the new NNI Policy provides for the establishment of an NNI Policy Review Committee, which is supposed to meet on a quarterly basis.</seg>
<seg id="503">Can the minister confirm who has been appointed to serve on the NNI Policy Review Committee?</seg>
<seg id="504">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="505">The NNI Review Committee is not an appointed committee.</seg>
<seg id="506">It’s a committee formed under the NNI Implementation Act and it’s following the previous NNI Policy, which also had the review committee.</seg>
<seg id="507">The people that serve on the review committee are the staff from the NNI Secretariat and also NTI, who deals with their Inuit Firm Registry.</seg>
<seg id="508">Your final supplementary, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="509">Ms. Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="510">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="511">Section 17 of the new NNI Policy provides for bid adjustments in the government’s procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="512">The new NNI Policy now provides for additional bid adjustments for Inuit firms with higher ownership levels.</seg>
<seg id="513">To illustrate, the new NNI Policy provides that a firm with 100 percent Inuit ownership level will receive an additional 5 percent bid adjustment above what firms with lower Inuit ownership levels are entitled to receive. That was very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="514">It is the responsibility of NTI to determine the relative levels of Inuit ownership of firms on its registry.</seg>
<seg id="515">Can the minister confirm if NTI has provided the government with an updated listing of firms, including their Inuit ownership ratings?</seg>
<seg id="516">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="517">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="518">Mr. Speaker, the Inuit Firm Registry is a registry that is dealt with by the Inuit organization designated to register Inuit firms and currently that is Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="519">They do the listing for the Inuit Firm Registry. I have not heard of currently whether they have provided us a list, but I do know the list is readily available on the website.</seg>
<seg id="520">Oral Questions. Member for South Baffin, Mr. David Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="521">Question 720 – 4(3): Community Justice Initiatives (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="522">I have questions for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="523">Mr. Speaker, community justice outreach workers are responsible for ensuring that Nunavummiut are able to access remedies provided under the Family Abuse Intervention Act, such as emergency protection orders and community intervention orders, within their communities.</seg>
<seg id="524">During our recent winter sitting, members were informed that the Department of Justice was working to transfer a number of community justice outreach worker positions from municipal governments to newly created positions within the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="525">Can the minister indicate how many community justice outreach worker positions have been transferred from the municipal governments to the Government of Nunavut as of today?</seg>
<seg id="526">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Justice, Mr. Keith Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="527">It’s my sincere pleasure to give Minister Monica Ell-Kanayuk a break from question period here.</seg>
<seg id="528">I hope I can answer as well as she has.</seg>
<seg id="529">Mr. Speaker, the plan was to transfer five positions this year.</seg>
<seg id="530">Two have been completed, one is in the process, and two are also in the process, but we’re looking for office space.</seg>
<seg id="531">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="532">Can the minister tell us what specific benefits these transfers will have for the individuals who fill these positions and the communities that they serve?</seg>
<seg id="533">Minister of Justice, Mr. Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="534">It’s anticipated that they will have a closer working relationship with our department and we will be able to provide more direction and support to them; reporting relationships, training, and other benefits of that sort.</seg>
<seg id="535">In some communities it’s difficult for CJOWs to focus on their work. Under the contribution agreement, they may be asked to do other work for the hamlet. In this case they would just focus on the work that the Department of Justice requires them to do.</seg>
<seg id="536">Your final supplementary, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="537">I thank again the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="538">Can the minister clarify if these community justice outreach workers are also responsible for providing administrative support to community justice committees and, if not, can he clarify who is?</seg>
<seg id="539">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Justice, Mr. Keith Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="540">Of course the Government of Nunavut appreciates all the hard volunteer work that community justice committees provide in providing a continuum of justice from the community level and up.</seg>
<seg id="541">I know a lot of the volunteers commit many hours of their free time to the service in their communities. Through the Department of Justice, through the CJOWs, we do provide support for the community justice committees.</seg>
<seg id="542">It may vary between communities depending on who the individual is, but we do provide a level of support to the justice committees.</seg>
<seg id="543">Question 721 – 4(3): Results of Beer and Wine Store Plebiscite in Rankin Inlet (Sammurtok, A)</seg>
<seg id="544">My question is to the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="545">Earlier this month plebiscites were held in the communities of Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay on the question of whether or not beer and wine stores should be opened in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="546">In Rankin Inlet approximately 38 percent of eligible voters went to the polls; 372 votes were cast for the “yes” side of the question and 127 votes were cast for the “no” side of the question.</seg>
<seg id="547">Can the minister provide a clear timetable for when the government will make a decision concerning whether or not to open a beer and wine store in Rankin Inlet?</seg>
<seg id="548">It was indeed a very good turnout for the community of Rankin Inlet and also for the community of Cambridge Bay.</seg>
<seg id="549">Voters in those communities spoke very loudly with their vote what they wanted, in this case a beer and wine store.</seg>
<seg id="550">As I said, it was a non-binding plebiscite, so the government is not bound to move forward or anything on establishing a beer and wine store soon in either community.</seg>
<seg id="551">It is likely that we will do some further consultations. We will have to look at putting regulations in the Liquor Act. We will also probably have to do additional consultations in the community to talk about how the beer and wine store would operate.</seg>
<seg id="552">I don’t anticipate that it will be something that this government will be able to accomplish.</seg>
<seg id="553">Based on my knowledge and experience here in Iqaluit with the Iqaluit Beer and Wine Store, that vote was on April 20 of 2015 and if the current plans are maintained, we won’t be opening a beer and wine store in Iqaluit until hopefully mid to late July of this year. That is over two years.</seg>
<seg id="554">What specific factors will the government consider in making the decision as to whether or not to open a beer and wine store in Rankin Inlet?</seg>
<seg id="555">Minister of Finance, Mr. Keith Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="556">Well, one of the main factors in the community of Rankin Inlet or any community for sure would be the availability of a facility.</seg>
<seg id="557">We do have a facility in Rankin Inlet, the Rankin Inlet Liquor Warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="558">If you would, let’s say, go to Cambridge Bay, there is no facility and there is no liquor warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="559">Definitely a facility would be required and that would be a main priority.</seg>
<seg id="560">In Iqaluit we have the liquor warehouse here. We are making renovations to the liquor warehouse so that we can sell beer and wine there. That would be the main consideration.</seg>
<seg id="561">Again, we’re going to do some more consultations with people in the community, special interest groups, and the hamlet council and talk about hours of operation, days of operation, and other things that they may raise with us, just to make sure everybody understands what the beer and wine store would accomplish and how it will operate.</seg>
<seg id="562">When I arrived in Iqaluit for the current sitting, it appeared that construction work is being undertaken to convert the government’s liquor warehouse in this community into a retail outlet.</seg>
<seg id="563">As the minister is aware, there is a similar warehouse facility in Rankin Inlet. Is Rankin Inlet’s liquor warehouse physically suited to being expanded or converted into a retail facility?</seg>
<seg id="564">Speaker: The Hon. Minister of Finance, Mr. Keith Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="565">In Iqaluit we did take the liquor warehouse, and then we’re building an addition and we’re calling it the beer and wine store.</seg>
<seg id="566">It’s part of it, but we’re not selling liquor out of the beer and wine store. We’re selling beer and wine.</seg>
<seg id="567">I have been on a couple of tours of the warehouse in Rankin Inlet and it’s a very nice facility.</seg>
<seg id="568">I’m not an architect or engineer. This is my amateur assessment. I would say that it offers potential to be renovated to some degree to sell beer and wine, but again, I’m not an expert.</seg>
<seg id="569">We have to fund these beer and wine store facilities through our Nunavut Liquor Commission Revolving Fund, so we will also be constrained by the amount of financing we have available. We don’t want to go to the Government of Nunavut seeking appropriation for doing renovations. We would try to do everything through our revolving fund.</seg>
<seg id="570">Obviously if there’s an existing facility, then that in itself could help us open a beer and wine store without too much cost other than the cost of renovations.</seg>
<seg id="571">The time for question period has expired. (interpretation ends) Hon. Member for Aivilik, Mr. Steve Mapsalak.</seg>
<seg id="572">I would like to ask for unanimous consent to go back to Item 5 in the Orders of the Day.</seg>

<seg id="679">Appendix – May 30, 2017</seg>
<seg id="680">Return to Written Question</seg>
<seg id="681">Asked of: Hon. Paul Quassa, MLA</seg>
<seg id="682">Minister of Education</seg>
<seg id="683">Number: 023 - 4(3)</seg>
<seg id="684">Date: 14 March, 2017</seg>
<seg id="685">Subject: Promotion Decisions under Section 15 of the  Education Act</seg>
<seg id="686">Question 1:</seg>
<seg id="687">Broken down by community and school, how many students in grades 9-12 were promoted within the meaning of section 15 of the Education Act during each of the following school years:</seg>
<seg id="688">Response:</seg>
<seg id="689">Please note that the response to Question 1 has been incorporated in the response to Question 2.</seg>
<seg id="690">Question 2:</seg>
<seg id="691">Broken down by community and school, how many students in grades 9-12 were denied promotion within the meaning of section 15 of the Education Act during each of the following school years:</seg>
<seg id="692">Response:</seg>
<seg id="693">Grade 9</seg>
<seg id="694">It is important to note that from Kindergarten through grade 9, a student is either promoted from one grade to the next or retained in their current grade.</seg>
<seg id="695">However, for reasons explained below related to the high school credit system and the unique path each student takes in moving through those grades, grade 9 is the last grade where promotion from one grade to the next, or retention in the current grade, happens in an absolute sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">The following table presents the relevant statistics, at a territorial level, for the promotion and retention of students at the end of grade 9 for the requested school years.</seg>
<seg id="697">These figures have not been broken down by school as the department is unable to release such data as per Section 23 of the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, as with such small numbers it is possible that individual students could be identified.</seg>

<seg id="710">Notes:</seg>
<seg id="711">*Data for the Kivalliq region may have been impacted by the switchover in the 2012-2013 school year from Student Record (SR) to Student Information System (SIS).</seg>

<seg id="713">Their information was omitted from the table above.</seg>

<seg id="748">Notes:</seg>
<seg id="749">For the 2014-15 school year there were three Grade 9 students without a GN ID number.</seg>
<seg id="750">Their information was omitted from the table above.</seg>
<seg id="751">There was insufficient promotion/retention data for a territory-wide total of 97 students.</seg>
<seg id="752">Their information was omitted from the table above.</seg>
<seg id="753">Retired/Transferred refers to students who either exited the school system or transferred to another school system.</seg>
<seg id="754">Grades 10-12</seg>
<seg id="755">Entry to grade 10 allows for a variety of academic options to cater to a student’s educational and career needs.</seg>
<seg id="756">According to current practice, when a student first registers in a senior secondary school program, the student will be designated as a Grade 10 student.</seg>
<seg id="757">Each personal learning path is unique.</seg>
<seg id="758">Students are placed in courses to fit their needs, at various grade levels depending on the student.</seg>
<seg id="759">As they collect credits from successful courses they would move through the high school grades taking—depending on how they may be paced on entry to grade 10—for example, Academic, General or Knowledge and Employment (KAE) classes.</seg>
<seg id="760">Students who have completed a minimum of 35 credits are designated as Grade 11 when they register in any new courses, and students who have completed a minimum of 70 credits will be designated as Grade 12 when they register in any new courses.</seg>
<seg id="761">For example, potentially, students may be considered Grade 11 due to their credit designation but they can be enrolled in Grade 10 courses.</seg>
<seg id="762">This is a normal and common occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="763">In short, retention in a particular grade does not play a role in the high school setting in the same manner that it does from Kindergarten through grade 9.</seg>
<seg id="764">For these reasons, it is not possible to collect or present accurate figures that would show the promotion data within the meaning of Section 15 of the Education Act for the required years for students taking classes between Grades 10 to 12.</seg>
<seg id="765">Due to the high school credit process, relevant figures for this time in a student’s development would include attendance and graduation rates.</seg>
<seg id="766">Question 3:</seg>
<seg id="767">Broken down by community and school, how many students in grades 9-12 were denied promotion within the meaning of section 15 of the Education Act on the grounds of academic achievement during each of the following school years:</seg>
<seg id="768">Response:</seg>
<seg id="769">The numbers of students retained from advancing beyond grade 9, per region and per the requested years are included in the response to Question 2.</seg>
<seg id="770">No further distinctions are made beyond what is included above.</seg>
<seg id="771">As explained above, students earning credits from Grades 10 to 12 move through the upper secondary years based on a credit system.</seg>
<seg id="772">Programs fitting their needs should have been found through the career and program planning process.</seg>
<seg id="773">Students in some cases can cross multiple grades based upon their credit count and academic path.</seg>
<seg id="774">(For additional information regarding section 15 of the Education Act, please see attached appendix)</seg>
<seg id="775">BACKGROUND</seg>
<seg id="776">Section 15 of the Education Act states that:</seg>
<seg id="777">The school team, in accordance with the directions of the Minister, is responsible  for determining the promotion of students.</seg>
<seg id="778">The School Team</seg>
<seg id="779">The School Team would meet to determine the promotion of a student and would deny promotion in very rare cases and at the insistence of the Parent or Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="780">When considering the retention of a student, the School Team has to take into account the principles described in Inuglugijaittuq: Foundation for Inclusive Education in Nunavut Schools.</seg>
<seg id="781">In deciding to not promote a student, the School Team must give careful consideration to these principles:</seg>
<seg id="782">Performance in Nunavut classrooms must be understood within the context of bilingualism.</seg>
<seg id="783">Educators must continually ask if a child’s difficulty learning is the result of learning in a second language or other factors.</seg>
<seg id="784">All practices and tools used to support student learning must take into consideration the first and second language context and abilities of students.</seg>
<seg id="785">The language context influences both the content and the process of instruction; educators must use differentiated instruction to meet varied student learning styles and language abilities.</seg>
<seg id="786">RETURN TO WRITTEN QUESTION</seg>
<seg id="787">Asked by: Paul Okalik, MLA for Iqaluit-Sinaa</seg>
<seg id="788">Asked of: Hon. Keith Peterson, Minister of Finance  Number: WQ 24-4(3) Date: March 14, 2017</seg>
<seg id="789">Subject: Administration of Human Resources Manual (HRM) Directive</seg>
<seg id="790">206: Preferential Treatment</seg>
<seg id="791">Broken down by department, Territorial Corporation and Crown Agency, how many approvals were granted within the meaning of section #6 of HRM Directive 206: Preferential Treatment during the</seg>
<seg id="792">2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017 (to date) fiscal years?</seg>
<seg id="793">Responsibility for implementing section #6 lies with the Deputy Head within each department or agency, in consultation with the Deputy Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="794">This information is not tracked at the GN-level.</seg>
<seg id="795">At the departmental level, any documentation relating to HRM 206 becomes part of each individual employee’s personnel folder.</seg>
<seg id="796">Departments do not compile this information centrally and cannot readily provide consolidated data.</seg>
<seg id="797">Broken down by department, Territorial Corporation and Crown Agency, how many approvals were granted within the meaning of section #7 of the HRM Directive 206: Preferential Treatment during the 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017 (to date) fiscal years?</seg>
<seg id="798">Responsibility for implementing section #7 lies with the Deputy Head within each department or agency, in consultation with the Deputy Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="799">This information is not tracked at the GN-level.</seg>
<seg id="800">At the departmental level, any documentation relating to HRM 206 becomes part of each individual employee’s personnel folder.</seg>
<seg id="801">Departments do not compile this information and cannot readily provide consolidated data.</seg>
<seg id="802">Broken down by department, Territorial Corporation and Crown Agency, how many approvals were granted within the meaning of section #8 of the Human Resources Manual Directive 206: Preferential Treatment during the 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017 (to date) fiscal years?</seg>
<seg id="803">Responsibility for implementing section #8 lies with the Deputy Head within each department or agency.</seg>
<seg id="804">Any documentation relating to HRM 206 becomes part of the individual employee’s personnel folder.</seg>
<seg id="805">Departments do not compile this information and cannot readily provide consolidated data.</seg>
<seg id="806">Please note that although the specific number of disclosures under HRM 206 is not centrally tracked, the Department of Finance employs a number of mechanisms to enforce the government’s rules and policies against preferential treatment.</seg>
<seg id="807">Code of Values and Ethics</seg>
<seg id="808">The responsibility for declaring a conflict of interest, including the potential for preferential treatment, lies with each public servant as outlined in the Nunavut Public Service Code of Values and Ethics.</seg>
<seg id="809">Employees are required to review the Code upon being hired, and periodic information bulletins are sent to all employees reminding them of their obligations.</seg>
<seg id="810">Employees found to be in contravention of any part of the Code are subject to progressive discipline, up to and including dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="811">Internal Accommodations</seg>
<seg id="812">Internal mechanisms exist within the GN to accommodate employees after a declaration of a conflict of interest is received.</seg>
<seg id="813">These accommodations are established on a case by case basis dependant on the working relationship and closeness of said individuals.</seg>
<seg id="814">This can include replacing the conflicted person on a hiring panel, reassigning an employee to a different supervisor, or making similar accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="815">All hiring panels include an independent staffing consultant from the Department of Finance, in order to ensure fairness and consistency and to avoid the possibility of preferential treatment.</seg>
<seg id="816">Reporting Mechanisms</seg>
<seg id="817">When a GN employee has concerns of impropriety or wrongdoing within the GN, including violations of HRM 206, there are mechanisms for reporting these concerns.</seg>
<seg id="818">Part 6 of the Public Service Act (PSA) creates a process for employees to disclose wrongdoing to their supervisors and an independent Ethics Officer without fear of reprisal.</seg>
<seg id="819">An employee reports the suspected wrongdoing to their supervisor, and in the absence of action, escalates the report th rough to their deputy head.</seg>
<seg id="820">If the deputy head fails to act, then the employee can report wrongdoing to any other deputy head, including the Deputy Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="821">Deputy heads have a duty to act on these reports.</seg>
<seg id="822">Employees can also consult with the Ethics Officer prior to making a disclosure under the Act.</seg>
<seg id="823">If the employee is not satisfied that authorities within the public service have taken reasonable steps to investigate and correct the wrongdoing, they may disclose the wrongdoing to the independent Ethics Officer for his investigation.</seg>

<seg id="966">For the 2015-2016 fiscal year, 17 applications were approved and went on to receive funding under the Strategic Investments Program.</seg>
<seg id="967">For the 2016-2017 fiscal year 28 applications were approved and funded.</seg>
<seg id="968">The exact number of applications that were received and rejected was not consistently tracked.</seg>
<seg id="969">This is because each of the four offices involved in administration of the program has historically recorded such applications differently and has not consistently differentiated between applications that are rejected based on ineligibility, withdrawn, denied based on lack of merit or incomplete applications.</seg>
<seg id="970">The department is developing clear internal procedures to allow this information to be tracked consistently in the future.</seg>
<seg id="971">The application requirements for the Strategic Investment Program are outlined in the Policy:</seg>
<seg id="972">For Schedule A: Nunavut Business Investment, applicants must submit a completed and signed application form.</seg>
<seg id="973">That includes the following:</seg>
<seg id="974">Financing package that includes:</seg>
<seg id="975">Arms-length Debt Financing or Equity Investment in the required proportions; and</seg>
<seg id="976">A client contribution, which can take the form of cash, sweat equity or existing assets.</seg>
<seg id="977">Business plan demonstrating potential for viability, sustainability and growth;</seg>
<seg id="978">Three-year historical financial statements (if available);</seg>
<seg id="979">Evidence that the initiative will provide net economic benefit beyond the financial return to the applicants;</seg>
<seg id="980">Evidence that the initiative will create new jobs for Nunavummiut;</seg>
<seg id="981">Evidence of a capable and experienced management team; Evidence that the requested NBIF contribution will complete the required funding package and result in the project being fully funded; and</seg>
<seg id="982">Evidence that costs associated with the initiative are reasonable and that a sound procurement process will be followed for major project components.</seg>
<seg id="983">For Schedule B: Nunavut Economic Foundations, applicants must submit a completed and signed application form that includes the following:</seg>
<seg id="984">The project’s potential for viability, sustainability and growth;</seg>
<seg id="985">How the project supports the Department’s strategic priorities or the economic development priorities of the community in which the project will take place;</seg>
<seg id="986">Demonstration that the project will provide net economic benefit;</seg>
<seg id="987">Demonstration of a capable and experienced management team;</seg>
<seg id="988">Evidence that the project’s costs are reasonable and that the project will use sound, competitive procurement methods for the purchase of all goods and services which make up a significant portion of project costs; and</seg>
<seg id="989">For the purchase of existing operations or assets, an independent professional valuation appropriate to the operation or asset being purchased and any other information requested by the department to assess possible conflicts of interest.</seg>
<seg id="990">The reporting requirements for the Strategic Investment Program are outlined in the contribution agreements and contain requirements specific to each project.</seg>
<seg id="991">The policy requires that the reporting requirements include certain basic elements:</seg>
<seg id="992">Recipients are required to submit a report on the activities carried out, and the outcomes and benefits achieved by the supported project; the report must address how these compare to the expected outcomes and benefits of the initiative.</seg>
<seg id="993">Recipients of contributions exceeding $100,000 are required to submit audited financial statements, at the discretion of the Department, along with an audited Schedule of Revenue and Expenses pertaining to the Conditional Contribution Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="994">In addition, interim financial information must be submitted to the Department within 60 days of the end of the Government of Nunavut fiscal year in which the contribution was made.</seg>
<seg id="995">Question 1(h):</seg>
<seg id="996">As of March 31, 2017, how much has the Government spent on settlements for employees who declined to accept offers of employment for decentralized positions, and who subsequently departed the Public Service?</seg>
<seg id="997">Clarifications for Question 1(h):</seg>
<seg id="998">This includes all individuals who selected option (c) within 90 days of receipt of their letter on the decentralization initiative and who had departed the public service as of March 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="999">It would not include individuals who formally declined to accept offers of employment but</seg>
<seg id="1000">deferred their actual departure dates and had not departed the public service as of March 31,  2017.</seg>
<seg id="1001">This amount also includes removal costs.</seg>
<seg id="1002">AND  Question 1(i):</seg>
<seg id="1003">As of March 31, 2017, what has been the total cost to the Government of Nunavut for the decentralization initiative, including, but not limited to, the following areas of expenditure:</seg>
<seg id="1004">i. Relocation and removal costs for employees;</seg>
<seg id="1005">ii. Settlements and other compensation for employees declining offers of employment for decentralized positions;</seg>
<seg id="1006">iii. Advertising and recruitment;</seg>
<seg id="1007">iv. Infrastructure, office renovations and other capital expenditures, including all costs associated with the construction, provision and furnishing of staff housing in decentralized communities; and</seg>
<seg id="1008">v. Administrative and miscellaneous costs, including expenditures incurred by the  Decentralization Secretariat of the EIA?</seg>
<seg id="1009">Response to Questions 1(h) and 1(i):</seg>
<seg id="1010">The Decentralization Secretariat was dissolved and removed from EIA’s organizational structure per Cabinet approval at the end of the First Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1011">Therefore, the costs presented in the response to the Return to Written Question No. 10-2(4) in 2008 were the final values.</seg>

<seg id="49">Speaker (Hon. George Qulaut) (interpretation): Can you say the opening prayer, please, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="50">Speaker (interpretation): Good afternoon, my fellow Nunavummiut. Members, ministers, and (interpretation ends) Premier, (interpretation) welcome to the House.</seg>
<seg id="51">Before we proceed, I will read a letter that I have received from the Commissioner of Nunavut. It reads:</seg>
<seg id="52">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, I wish to advise that I recommend to the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut the passage of the following bills during the Third Session of the Fourth Legislative Assembly:</seg>
<seg id="53">Bill 46, Appropriation (Capital) Act, No. 1, 2018-2019</seg>
<seg id="54">Sincerely, Nellie T. Kusugak, Order of Nunavut, Commissioner of Nunavut</seg>
<seg id="55">(interpretation) Item 2.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ministers’ Statements. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Premier of Nunavut, Mr. Taptuna.</seg>
<seg id="57">Minister’s Statement 296 – 4(3): Canada Post Unveils Nunavut Stamp for Canada at 150 (Taptuna)</seg>
<seg id="58">Hon. Peter Taptuna (interpretation): Good afternoon, my colleagues, Nunavummiut, and Kuglukturmiut.</seg>
<seg id="59">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, yesterday Canada Post unveiled a stamp as part of Canada’s 150th anniversary and celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="60">The stamp features Leah Ejangiaq Kines from Arctic Bay. It’s a photo of her taken by her husband, Clare Kines.</seg>
<seg id="61">As part of a series, the Nunavut stamp honours 10 national moments in Canada’s history.</seg>
<seg id="62">Mr. Speaker, the stamp celebrates a special moment in Canadian history: the creation of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="63">For Inuit it was a life-changing moment and one that Inuit had championed for many years prior to signing the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement on April 1, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="64">While Canada celebrates its 150th anniversary this year, Nunavut only celebrates its 18th year as a territory, yet Inuit history in our land spans thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="65">Having the right to self-government is deeply important to Nunavummiut and I am proud that we have come this far together.</seg>
<seg id="66">I would like to thank the Speaker, the Commissioner of Nunavut, Canada Post, guests, and Members of the Assembly for joining us yesterday for the special unveiling that celebrates Nunavut’s creation.</seg>
<seg id="67">Minister’s Statement 297 – 4(3): Sound Fields in Education for Nunavut Youth (Quassa)</seg>
<seg id="68">Inclusive education promotes a model of education where all students have access to the education program with their peers.</seg>
<seg id="69">Mr. Speaker, many of our students suffer from hearing loss. This has an impact on their ability to learn. It also affects their social and emotional development.</seg>
<seg id="70">The prevalence of hearing loss in Nunavut children is estimated to be up to 40 percent higher than in other parts of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="71">There are limited opportunities for formal screening of preschool or school-aged children, so hearing loss can go undiagnosed until later in the child’s life.</seg>
<seg id="72">My department is taking action to support students with both known and undiagnosed hearing loss through the sound fields for learning project.</seg>
<seg id="73">Mr. Speaker, since 2015 ten schools have had sound field systems installed in learning spaces to amplify the teacher’s voice to ensure students hear clearly.</seg>
<seg id="74">The installations were launched along with hands-on training for staff, students, and parents around hearing loss and its connection to learning.</seg>
<seg id="75">This initial phase was accomplished through a partnership with Better Hearing in Education for Northern Youth and Qikiqtani School Operations.</seg>
<seg id="76">My department will continue with the project and has ordered 200 new systems to be installed in the remaining schools across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="77">This project supports students by addressing hearing loss as a barrier to learning.</seg>
<seg id="78">Minister’s Statement 298 – 4(3): Let’s Be Aware/Ujjiqsuqta Launched (Peterson)</seg>
<seg id="79">Hon. Keith Peterson: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about Let’s Be Aware/Ujjiqsuqta, a responsible use of alcohol campaign that I publicly launched in Cambridge Bay on March 22 and that is now being rolled out across Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="80">Let’s Be Aware/Ujjiqsuqta was developed to promote healthy and informed choices as a way to prevent alcohol-related harm throughout the territory.</seg>
<seg id="81">The campaign will help Nunavut move toward the vision Nunavummiut have described: healthier and happier communities and safer communities where the negative effects of alcohol are significantly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="82">The goal of the campaign is to empower local communities through education and awareness. Materials, resources, and activities in all languages are being created for the general public, alcohol education committees, individuals working in helping professions, as well as youth and young adults.</seg>
<seg id="83">Mr. Speaker, Nunavummiut can also find useful information, facts, tips, and resources on the Let’s Be Aware/Ujjiqsuqta website at www.responsiblenunavut.ca or www.ujjiqsuqta.ca.</seg>
<seg id="84">Minister’s Statement 299 – 4(3): FANS Enhancements (Mike)</seg>
<seg id="85">Before I start, the residents of my community are in my thoughts as they will be attending a funeral this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="86">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that effective April 1, 2017 changes have been made to the Financial Assistance for Nunavut Student (FANS) program to allow more individuals to access student financial assistance for post-secondary education and reduce the amount of personal financial burden that students incur.</seg>
<seg id="87">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, the Department of Family Services has increased the amount of reimbursement for adult learners in successfully completed distance education courses from $250 per course, plus $200 for books, plus fees and postage, to $1,000 per course, including books, fees, and software with a lifetime limit of $10,000 of reimbursed expenses.</seg>
<seg id="88">Increasing support to distance education studies will allow more adults to access learning opportunities while also attending to their work and home commitments.</seg>
<seg id="89">(interpretation) The second change is an increase to the number of cities eligible for travel benefits under the FANS basic grant. (interpretation ends) The department recognizes that a growing number of Nunavut post-secondary students are attending institutions outside of Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton, and Winnipeg. (interpretation) The number of cities has now been expanded to 31 across Canada, which will reduce or eliminate the additional travel costs students previously needed to pay themselves.</seg>
<seg id="90">Mr. Speaker, these enhancements are a direct result of our commitment and dedication to providing the best assistance for our students, and to ensure that a lack of finances does not pose a barrier to post-secondary education.</seg>
<seg id="91">Minister’s Statement 300 – 4(3): Nunavut Community Cleanups (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="92">I am pleased to inform members that again this year the Department of Environment will be organizing community cleanups across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="93">For over a decade now this annual event has become a key component of the department’s pollution prevention program.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition to cleaning up litter that accumulates over the winter, the cleanups have proven successful in fostering community pride.</seg>
<seg id="95">All communities across Nunavut are participating this year and they will be holding community cleanups some time before the end of July.</seg>
<seg id="96">Mr. Speaker, the Nunavut community cleanups are a joint effort between the Department of Environment and hamlets throughout the territory.</seg>
<seg id="97">Nunavut Tourism and corporate sponsors also play an important role in these events.</seg>
<seg id="98">Students in schools throughout Nunavut were invited to participate in a contest designing a t-shirt and a poster for the event.</seg>
<seg id="99">I would like to congratulate all students who participated in the 2016-17 contest.</seg>
<seg id="100">The winners are Jenova Aggark, a grade 6 student at Qitiqliq Middle School in Arviat designed the winning t-shirt, and Isabel Tugak, a grade 1 student at Rachel Arngnammaktiq Elementary School in Baker Lake designed the winning poster.</seg>
<seg id="101">Congratulations to Jenova and Rachel!</seg>
<seg id="102">Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Nunavummiut to get involved in this cleanup event and show our pride in this great land we call home.</seg>
<seg id="103">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="104">Minister’s Statement 301 – 4(3): Math and Science Award (Ell-Kanayuk)</seg>
<seg id="105">Math and science are important foundations for many great careers, including geologists to airline pilots.</seg>
<seg id="106">The Department of Economic Development and Transportation recognizes students in grades 8, 10, and 12 with math and science awards for their skill, dedication, and effort in those subjects.</seg>
<seg id="107">Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I regularly rise to highlight the success of our high school and college graduates.</seg>
<seg id="108">Today I would like to shine the spotlight on some of the younger Nunavummiut, the grade 8 math and science awards recipients.</seg>

<seg id="126">Member’s Statement 555 – 4(3): Recent Fishing Derby in Arctic Bay (Shooyook)</seg>
<seg id="127">Good day to the people of Grise Fiord and Resolute Bay, residents of my community, and the people who are watching the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="128">Welcome to the Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="129">I rise today to express my pride in the people of my community.</seg>
<seg id="130">I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them. We have an annual fishing derby in our community and they try to catch either the largest fish or the smallest fish.</seg>
<seg id="131">They just went through that and we should be very proud of them.</seg>
<seg id="132">For the 2017 fishing derby, a novel approach was tried in awarding prizes.</seg>
<seg id="133">The first prize is a snowmobile for catching the largest fish. The second prize is large as well, which is $5,000.</seg>
<seg id="134">There was another aspect for people who don’t have transportation equipment to catch sculpins, which was the oldest sculpin.</seg>
<seg id="135">There was also a prize to the winner who got the largest sculpin of $5,000.</seg>
<seg id="136">I’m very proud of them.</seg>
<seg id="137">Mr. Speaker, there was a tie when fish were measured as to which one is longer.</seg>
<seg id="138">They had to declare it a draw.</seg>
<seg id="139">It was an absolute tie. My daughter-in-law’s name was drawn and she won a brand-new snowmobile.</seg>
<seg id="140">The fishing derby really is a positive event for the community. I want to express my pride.</seg>
<seg id="141">I would like all my fellow MLAs here to join me in applauding this event as well as the people who are watching the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="142">Member’s Statement 556 – 4(3): Commissioner’s Awards Ceremony in Kimmirut (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="143">Good day to my colleagues, the people of Cape Dorset and Kimmirut, and the people who are listening to the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="144">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a number of my constituents in Kimmirut who recently received Commissioner’s Awards.</seg>
<seg id="145">Mr. Speaker, as I noted in my member’s statement yesterday, I had the honour of welcoming Commissioner Nellie Kusugak to the community at the end of March.</seg>
<seg id="146">Her visit, which coincided with the opening of the community’s new wellness centre, marked an occasion to recognize the achievements and contributions of a number of deserving individuals.</seg>
<seg id="147">Mr. Speaker, the recipients of the Commissioner’s Awards for Bravery were Simeonie Aqpik and the late Gotileak Judea.</seg>
<seg id="148">Although Gotileak is no longer with us, he was able to be represented by his wife, Akulujuk Judea, and that worked out really well.</seg>
<seg id="149">Mr. Speaker, four Kimmirummiut were honoured with the Award for Humanitarianism: Pitseolak Qimirpik, J.J. Akavak, Donnie Kolola, and Kootoo Ikkidluak.</seg>
<seg id="150">They helped save Jawlie Akavak.</seg>
<seg id="151">People were really happy about that.</seg>
<seg id="152">Mr. Speaker, last but not least, special recognition awards were presented to the Kimmirut volunteer firefighters, the Kimmirut search and rescue team, and the Kimmirut Canadian Rangers Patrol.</seg>

<seg id="155">Member’s Statement 557 – 4(3): Recognizing the Needs of Smaller Communities (Sammurtok, T)</seg>
<seg id="156">Mr. Tom Sammurtok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker and the people of Chesterfield Inlet and Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="157">The people of Rankin Inlet are in my thoughts as we have just lost a loved one, as well as Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="158">I rise today to publicly extend a formal invitation to our cabinet to visit the community of Chesterfield Inlet after the conclusion of our spring sitting.</seg>
<seg id="159">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, as you know, I have the great privilege of representing the residents of two of Nunavut’s best and most beautiful communities…</seg>
<seg id="160">…Rankin Inlet and Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="161">Although my residence is in Rankin Inlet, my family has deep roots in Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="162">Mr. Speaker, as a regional centre, Rankin Inlet is always on the government’s radar screen. However, Chesterfield Inlet, as a smaller, non-decentralized community, often seems to fall off the radar screen and I consistently hear the message from the community that it feels ignored.</seg>
<seg id="163">Mr. Speaker, I am perfectly aware that a one- or two-day visit to a community does not solve everything.</seg>
<seg id="164">However, it is important for the government’s top leaders to see with their own eyes the conditions of our smaller communities and to meet face to face with the community’s local leaders.</seg>
<seg id="165">(interpretation) Mr. Speaker, I very much look forward to a positive response to my invitation, and (interpretation ends) I look forward to welcoming my friends opposite to Chesterfield Inlet this summer. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="166">Member’s Statement 558 – 4(3): High School Graduates from Qikiqtarjuaq (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="167">I say “good day” to all of the people of Qikiqtarjuaq and Clyde River and to the people who are listening to and watching the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, before I get to my statement, I would first like to thank the minister responsible for the energy corporation for being able to come to our community. We are gratified by the minister’s visit to a very beautiful community, my community of Qikiqtarjuaq.</seg>
<seg id="169">Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my pride in the students who just graduated from our school. I would like to express my pride and congratulate them together with my colleagues here.</seg>
<seg id="170">We all know that when students complete grade 12, they can do whatever they want and take whatever further education they wish to acquire.</seg>
<seg id="171">We really encourage students to do that when they graduate.</seg>
<seg id="172">We haven’t had that many graduates from my community. In the previous year we had one graduate and now this year we have three graduates.</seg>
<seg id="173">We would like to say that we’re proud of them in whatever further education they choose.</seg>
<seg id="174">The three grade 12 graduates in Qikiqtarjuaq are Seemee Pitsiulak, Angela Kooneeliusie, and Kyle [Moesesie].</seg>
<seg id="175">We’re very proud of them all for graduating this past year.</seg>
<seg id="176">Member’s Statement 559 – 4(3): Fishing Derby Winners in Pangnirtung (Mike)</seg>
<seg id="177">I also thank my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="178">While we are on the subject of scenic communities, I also have a wonderfully scenic community in Pangnirtung. People from all over the world also travel to our community as tourists and visit. This includes world leaders who visited our community.</seg>
<seg id="179">I send my greetings to all the people who have visited our community.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is my preamble.</seg>
<seg id="181">Now, our elder MLA colleague spoke about arctic char and sculpin fishing derbies. In Pangnirtung the hamlet recreation committee held an arctic char and sculpin fishing derby on May 20. They went to Amittuq Lake for the arctic char fishing and they held the sculpin fishing derby right offshore of the community.</seg>
<seg id="182">I would like to mention the winners of the fishing derby.</seg>
<seg id="183">The adults who won are Willie Atagooyuk, Annie Nakashuk in second place, Alex Alivaktuk in third place, and Peter Kanayuk in fourth place.</seg>
<seg id="184">In the children’s class, Jaylynn Nuvaqiq, Kailey Kilabuk, and Benjamin Alivaktuk were the winners.</seg>
<seg id="185">In the sculpin fishing derby, Tommy Angnakak won first prize, second prize went to Jamie Qaqasiq, third prize went to Lena Kakkik, and tied in fourth place were Mary Karpik and Alookie Metuq.</seg>
<seg id="186">In the children’s sculpin fishing derby, Kaden Etuangat won first prize, Tina Joanne Nakashuk was second, and third was Kaden Etuangat.</seg>
<seg id="187">The cash prizes for the derby came from the hunters and trappers organization and the recreation committee, with a combined total of $20,000.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is an annual fishing derby that they hold in Pangnirtung for arctic char and sculpin.</seg>
<seg id="189">Members’ Statements.</seg>
<seg id="190">I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="191">Moving on. Item 4.</seg>
<seg id="192">Member for Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu, Ms. Pat Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="193">Question 722 – 4(3): Staff Housing (Angnakak)</seg>
<seg id="194">Ms. Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="195">Mr. Speaker, my questions are for the Minister responsible for the Nunavut Housing Corporation and they concern the Nunavut Housing Corporation’s Blueprint for Action on Housing.</seg>
<seg id="196">Action No. 22 in the blueprint indicates that the Nunavut Housing Corporation will work with the Department of Finance to, and I quote, “analyze the current staff housing rents and subsidies to determine appropriate subsidy levels that encourage staff housing tenants to transition out of government-subsidized housing and into private rental or homeownership.”</seg>
<seg id="197">When I asked the minister about the status of this work back in March, he told the House that he had not been given an update on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="198">I guess today my question is: is the minister in a position today to tell us what the government is doing?</seg>
<seg id="199">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister responsible for the Nunavut Housing Corporation, Mr. George Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="200">Good afternoon, my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="201">I also thank my colleague for that very good question.</seg>
<seg id="202">Mr. Speaker, I clearly remember the member’s question. To date in regard to staff housing, I stated that it was going to be reviewed and they’re still reviewing or analyzing the current staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="203">I can’t respond to the member’s question because they’re still working on it.</seg>
<seg id="204">Perhaps the minister can do a Minister’s Statement in the next few days as to when he expects that to be done.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, an ongoing issue of concern, especially in smaller communities, is the lack of suitable staff housing for teachers and nurses.</seg>
<seg id="206">This shortage impacts the ability of the government to recruit these essential positions.</seg>
<seg id="207">Action No. 41 in the Nunavut Housing Corporation’s Blueprint for Action on Housing indicates that the Nunavut Housing Corporation will, and I quote, “Conduct an impact analysis of various approaches to social and staff housing delivery…” including, and I quote, “A lease-only model for certain communities whereby the NHC leases staff housing units from private developers.”</seg>
<seg id="208">The Blueprint for Action on Housing indicates that the Nunavut Housing Corporation will undertake pilot projects in this area.</seg>
<seg id="209">Can the minister tell us today when and where these pilot projects will take place?</seg>
<seg id="210">Minister responsible for the Nunavut Housing Corporation, Mr. Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="211">I again thank the member.</seg>
<seg id="212">Mr. Speaker, as I stated earlier in my response, we’re still working on it. Action No. 41 that the member is referring to is still part of the review and they’re still analyzing it for the communities. I can’t respond to that question because it’s part of the review on Action No. 41.</seg>
<seg id="213">With regard to the blueprint for action, it’s still being analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="214">Again I would like to ask if the minister perhaps can provide us with an update in the House as to when all this will be done and completed.</seg>
<seg id="215">Mr. Speaker, Action No. 21 in the Nunavut Housing Corporation’s Blueprint for Action on Housing indicates that the Nunavut Housing Corporation and the Department of Finance will, and I quote, “review and revise the GN’s Staff Housing Policy.”</seg>
<seg id="216">Can the minister tell us today if a new staff housing policy will be finalized before the end of the current Legislative Assembly?</seg>
<seg id="217">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister responsible for the Nunavut Housing Corporation, Mr. George Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="218">We expect this to be completed during the term of this government, but we don’t expect it to be finalized during this session. I’ll be more prepared to speak to it during the fall session.</seg>
<seg id="219">Question 723 – 4(3): Kivalliq Regional Visitor Centre (Sammurtok, A)</seg>
<seg id="220">My question is to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="221">In recent weeks I have received three different letters signed by the minister concerning the Kivalliq Regional Visitor Centre, which is currently in progress in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="222">One of these letters indicates that the project is “slated to be commissioned later this year…with an estimated total budget surplus of $1.5 million.”</seg>
<seg id="223">Another letter indicates that the surplus will be $535,000.</seg>
<seg id="224">The third letter indicates that the surplus will be $500,000.</seg>
<seg id="225">For the record, can the minister clarify today what the budget surplus figure for the Kivalliq Regional Visitor Centre actually is?</seg>
<seg id="226">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="227">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="228">The project is on schedule and the surplus funds are there while completing the project.</seg>
<seg id="229">Your first supplementary, Mr. Alexander Sammurtok.</seg>
<seg id="230">Can the minister clearly indicate the specific areas in which the Kivalliq regional centre project underspent its budget?</seg>
<seg id="231">Speaker (interpretation): Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="232">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="233">In my earlier comment I meant to say the project had sufficient funds.</seg>
<seg id="234">I don’t have the level of detail the member is asking of me.</seg>
<seg id="235">Your final supplementary, Mr. Alexander Sammurtok.</seg>
<seg id="236">Maybe the minister could provide us with that information on a later date.</seg>
<seg id="237">Can the minister confirm the date on which the new Kivalliq Regional Visitor Centre is expected to be opened to the public?</seg>
<seg id="238">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="239">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="240">I thank the member for that question. The project is proceeding as planned and I understand the Committee of the Whole will be discussing the funds for that project.</seg>
<seg id="241">Question 724 – 4(3): Rankin Inlet’s Freshwater Supply (Sammurtok, T)</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Tom Sammurtok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) My question is for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, there have been a number of reports in the media this past month that have raised concerns and questions regarding Nunavut’s freshwater supply.</seg>
<seg id="244">As the minister will recall, in the fall of 2016 I asked him a number of questions regarding Rankin Inlet’s freshwater supply, Nipissar Lake, which is rapidly depleting.</seg>
<seg id="245">In his response the minister stated that his department was “working on getting a water board licence to pump water from First Landing Lake” and that the department anticipated that it would be able to secure that licence “by early summer of 2017.”</seg>
<seg id="246">Can the minister provide the House today with an update on his department’s work to secure that water licence?</seg>
<seg id="247">Minister of Community and Government Services, Mr. Joe Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="248">Yes, I remember being asked that question.</seg>
<seg id="249">We are still working on the permitting process. The application is currently with NIRB.</seg>
<seg id="250">We believe that all the permitting needed will be done before summer. Once we have the proper permits in place, we will start pumping water to replenish their water supply.</seg>
<seg id="251">Speaker (interpretation ends): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="252">Mr. Tom Sammurtok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Can the minister tell us what contingency plans, if any, are currently in place in the event that the community’s freshwater supply is depleted or made suddenly inaccessible?</seg>
<seg id="253">The current rate of natural refilling to Nipissar Lake is less than the amount being consumed.</seg>
<seg id="254">Even if we were not to replenish it, there is enough water there for quite a few years.</seg>
<seg id="255">We’re fully confident that we will resolve the problem. We do have permission to run from Char River, but Char River only runs when First Landing Lake is high in water since it flows from there.</seg>
<seg id="256">We’re dealing with the situation and I can assure the residents of Rankin Inlet that they will not run out of water.</seg>
<seg id="257">Can the minister tell us what specific research or planning is currently being undertaken to monitor Nunavut’s current and future water supply needs?</seg>
<seg id="258">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Community and Government Services, Mr. Joe Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="259">I don’t think that we have an overall plan to study all the needs of Nunavut in one big, broad study.</seg>
<seg id="260">We are always looking at water consumption from each community and the resources they have, whether it be a man-made reservoir or a natural reservoir such as a lake, and we monitor them.</seg>
<seg id="261">There are some communities that are having a current water shortage right now and we deal with them. It’s a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg id="262">We do have funding under the Clean Water and Wastewater Fund and we use some of that to build new reservoirs or expand. We are just dealing with each community on their own merit.</seg>
<seg id="263">Question 725 – 4(3): Grays Bay Port and Road Project (Akoak)</seg>
<seg id="264">Mr. Akoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues, Nunavummiut, and the community of Gjoa Haven.</seg>
<seg id="265">My questions are for the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="266">The minister’s response to my recent written question concerning her department’s Strategic Investments Program was tabled yesterday in the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="267">Information contained in the response indicates that her department provided $550,000 to the Kitikmeot Inuit Association during the 2016-17 fiscal year to support the development of the Grays Bay Road and Port Project.</seg>
<seg id="268">For the record, I applaud the government for this important investment.</seg>
<seg id="269">Mr. Speaker, for the benefit of our viewing audience and also to my colleagues on this side of the House, can the minister describe how this project is benefitting the Kitikmeot?</seg>
<seg id="270">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="271">I believe he’s asking about Grays Bay, but it is still being proposed and there could be a lot of items. I believe your question is how this project is benefitting Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="272">It is fully supported by the Kivalliq Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="273">There are a lot of proposals to do for mining projects in those regions.</seg>
<seg id="274">It would also benefit people who would like to take additional training or who are proposing to learn a trade in order to work in that project.</seg>
<seg id="275">For example, there could be heavy equipment operator training and training for other job opportunities that might arise through this project. It could be a big benefit to both regions.</seg>
<seg id="276">Your first supplementary, Mr. Tony Akoak.</seg>
<seg id="277">Good to hear.</seg>
<seg id="278">I think you mentioned the Kivalliq instead of the Kitikmeot.</seg>
<seg id="279">Mr. Speaker, can the minister indicate what support her department is providing towards the Grays Bay Road and Port Project during the current 2017-18 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="280">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation) I also thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="281">I don’t have the information in front of me, but I do know that to date we haven’t set aside a large amount of money because we are currently negotiating and working together on this proposed project.</seg>
<seg id="282">We are currently negotiating how we can move this project forward.</seg>
<seg id="283">Your final supplementary, Mr. Tony Akoak.</seg>
<seg id="284">Can the minister describe what support the federal government is providing towards the Grays Bay Road and Port Project?</seg>
<seg id="285">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="286">All I can say right now is that the details of the new funding that was just initiated by the federal government are currently under review.</seg>
<seg id="287">It looks like there may be an opportunity to submit a proposal under the new federal initiative.</seg>
<seg id="288">Question 726 – 4(3): Cannabis Legalization (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="289">My questions are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="290">As the minister will be aware, his federal counterpart recently introduced Bill C-45 in the House of Commons.</seg>
<seg id="291">This federal bill proposes to legalize cannabis across the country.</seg>
<seg id="292">Mr. Speaker, our minister publicly stated in the Legislative Assembly last November that the Government of Nunavut has formed an interdepartmental working group to address the issue of marijuana legalization in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="293">Can the minister indicate what specific actions this working group has undertaken to date?</seg>
<seg id="294">The actions of the Government of Canada have certainly put a lot of pressure on provinces and territories to come up with some legislation to be ready for July 1, 2018. I think that’s the date I have heard.</seg>
<seg id="295">As the Minister of Justice and Attorney General for Nunavut and my colleagues across Canada, we have expressed our concern to the Minister of Justice of Canada and the Minister of Public Safety that it’s going to be very challenging for most jurisdictions to meet those deadlines and then have processes in place to distribute. It’s very complex anyway and probably more complex in Nunavut given our geography and our distribution network in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="296">Those are the kinds of issues that our interdepartmental working groups have been working on.</seg>
<seg id="297">Now that we’re near the end of May and we’re in an election year, it complicates things.</seg>
<seg id="298">We have to have legislation of some form in place in time for the federal legislation when it goes into force. Now we’ve got the pressure of territorial elections.</seg>
<seg id="299">We will be reviewing the recommendations on how to go forward and of course anything we decide will have to go through this cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="300">Bill C-45 is currently being considered by Parliament and has not yet become law.</seg>
<seg id="301">Will the Government of Nunavut be making a formal submission on this bill and, if so, will the Government of Nunavut be supporting or opposing the legalization of marijuana?</seg>
<seg id="302">Minister of Justice, Mr. Keith Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="303">I don’t believe this government is going to be, like most provinces and territories. I can’t speak for them all, but we have expressed our concerns with the legislation and the pressures it’s putting on us.</seg>
<seg id="304">We are going to move forward and try to meet their timelines, but it’s going to be a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="305">Some communities in Nunavut have chosen through local option votes to prohibit the possession or sale of alcohol while other communities have chosen to restrict the possession of this substance through the establishment of alcohol education committees.</seg>
<seg id="306">For the benefit of Nunavummiut who are following our proceedings today, can the Minister of Justice clarify whether or not Nunavut communities will be able to restrict the possession and sale of marijuana in the same way that alcohol is regulated and restricted?</seg>
<seg id="307">Minister of Justice, Mr. Keith Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="308">Mr. Mikkungwak certainly knows how to throw curveballs. Maybe he should pitch for the Toronto Blue Jays.</seg>
<seg id="309">He’s got a few knuckleballs, sliders, curveballs, and drop balls.</seg>
<seg id="310">As I said in my earlier answer, it’s going to be quite complicated. In Nunavut we only have the distribution network for alcohol, beer and wine in two warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="311">We have to figure all that out, the logistics and distribution. That’s why we have the interdepartmental working committee with a number of departments. There’s the legal side of things with Justice; distribution with Finance.</seg>
<seg id="312">There are health issues and there are other concerns. That will be something that we will be working on.</seg>
<seg id="313">We’re probably going to undertake… .</seg>
<seg id="314">I don’t want to put any timelines on it, but over the next few months or couple months leading up to September, there are some broad type of community consultations, go out and talk to groups, organizations, and hamlets and get their input, concerns, hear what they have to say, and maybe get some good recommendations on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="315">Question 727 – 4(3): Sewage Issues in Naujaat (Mapsalak)</seg>
<seg id="316">My question will be directed to the Minister of CGS.</seg>
<seg id="317">Mr. Speaker, I had posed this question at an earlier sitting regarding the lack of a sewage lagoon in Naujaat. At that time the minister indicated that it was not much of a concern.</seg>
<seg id="318">When there are studies done, we find that the raw sewage that is seeping into the ocean is way too small to be of concern.</seg>
<seg id="319">However, there are an increasing number of houses being built in Naujaat.</seg>
<seg id="320">Prior to coming here, I went to see the seepage and there’s quite a lot of raw material going into the sea and there’s even a bay or a pond being formed with raw sewage material.</seg>
<seg id="321">Mr. Speaker, can the minister indicate to me when it would become a concern and how much of a quantity would have to be seeping into the ocean for it to become a concern?</seg>
<seg id="322">I’ll answer the member’s question this way: it’s not the amount of liquids that would determine what is harmful to the ocean; it’s what the liquid is.</seg>
<seg id="323">If you have a water truck spill its whole load into the ocean, nobody would complain, but if you have a sewage truck spill its load to the ocean, then someone would complain and there would be regulations against that. It’s not the amount of sewage that is going into the ocean; it’s the quality or the condition or how much pollutants are in the liquid that is seeping out from natural sewage lagoons or wetland areas that go into the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="324">It’s what’s in the water, not the amount of the water.</seg>
<seg id="325">Indeed that may be, but it is rather unsightly to see raw sewage being dumped on the tundra with no designated lagoon.</seg>
<seg id="326">Further, that pond is getting larger due to the sewage dumping in that area.</seg>
<seg id="327">With that being the situation, the project was deferred or rather it was cut.</seg>
<seg id="328">I refer to the funding that was allocated for that project for the sewage lagoon. Furthermore, it was delayed.</seg>
<seg id="329">I wonder if the minister could respond to my question on what time frame is involved for this delay. How many years has it been pushed back?</seg>
<seg id="330">I can’t tell the member exactly how many years it’s postponed. It depends on the natural filtration system that is doing the work it’s supposed to for Naujaat.</seg>
<seg id="331">When the study was done, it was completed last year and the report was issued at the end of 2016 or early 2017, I believe, to my department.</seg>
<seg id="332">At that time the current conditions were the natural filtration of the wetlands was doing what it does on its own with sewage that was being pumped there.</seg>
<seg id="333">The member is right.</seg>
<seg id="334">There is going to come a point where something would have to be done because the quality of the sewage coming out from the natural filtration wetlands has to be of a certain quality. We can’t just dump raw sewage into the ocean. There are regulations against that.</seg>
<seg id="335">I can’t tell the member when the time will come, but there will be a time when natural filtration will not work due to the amount of sewage being produced in Naujaat.</seg>
<seg id="336">For now all I can tell the member is that we will monitor the situation and we will revisit the possible sewage lagoon in Naujaat in the future.</seg>
<seg id="337">Can the minister inform me of how often the studies are conducted? Is it once a year? How many times a year do they study the seepage to the ocean?</seg>
<seg id="338">Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Dalhousie University has been doing that study for the natural filtration wetland areas in communities.</seg>
<seg id="339">They take their samples in the summer. I don’t know exactly the process of how they do it. I’m going to assume they would take the samples where they dump the raw sewage, another one farther out, then farther out, and then farther out ‘til it’s closest to the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="340">It’s just done once a season per area, per sewage lagoon. That’s my understanding. The study is usually done just once because the natural filtration system would not change year after year unless something abnormal happened.</seg>
<seg id="341">Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Isaac Shooyook.</seg>
<seg id="342">Question 728 – 4(3): The Need for Improving Boarding Home Facilities (Shooyook)</seg>
<seg id="343">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="344">We in the Baffin region who seek medical attention are facing a lack of space at the Tammaativvik Boarding Home.</seg>
<seg id="345">Patients and pregnant women go here by airplane, and this is a very important issue. There have been serious concerns this year about lack of space at the boarding home.</seg>
<seg id="346">Has the minister looked into alternative solutions to this problem or has he been informed about the lack of space at the boarding home? When it’s over capacity, clients are put in hotels.</seg>
<seg id="347">Does this not result in increased spending or not?</seg>
<seg id="348">I would appreciate it if the minister can describe the problems associated with this issue.</seg>
<seg id="349">I appreciate the member raising this concern again.</seg>
<seg id="350">The Tammaativvik Boarding Home here in Iqaluit is typically run at 30 percent over capacity, leading to the need to utilize hotels and other facilities, even going so far as to billet people in people’s homes where needs arise.</seg>
<seg id="351">I have also heard concerns of even when people are in hotels, they may even have to change hotels or change rooms partway through their stay due to bookings. Iqaluit is a very busy city and there are different events going on.</seg>
<seg id="352">We do try to take that into consideration when we make specialist appointments. We look at what specialists needs are coming to the community in addition to what events are being held.</seg>
<seg id="353">We try not to put any additional strain on infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="354">We are in continual discussions with the ownership group and the management at the Tammaativvik Boarding Home to continually look at how we can address this ongoing concern. There is a lack of space in Iqaluit, so it is not an overnight solution that we can find.</seg>
<seg id="355">We do have challenges with the new announcement by the federal government of NIHB funding escort travel for maternity travel, which again increases the number of people at these facilities.</seg>
<seg id="356">That’s a very recent announcement, so we are still gauging the implications of that announcement.</seg>
<seg id="357">Mr. Speaker, I realize I’m not answering the question with a solution, but I can assure the member that we’re very aware and we’re in continual dialogue with partners to work towards finding a solution.</seg>
<seg id="358">Yes, I understand his response.</seg>
<seg id="359">This is a serious matter for medical travel. I’m not pointing at Iqaluit or Sanikiluaq.</seg>
<seg id="360">There are 12 communities that are having real problems with medical travel or with pregnant mothers coming in or those coming here for checkups and those who need CAT scans.</seg>
<seg id="361">With that being the case, there are real challenges with pregnant mothers being able have escorts.</seg>
<seg id="362">Lack of space will become more of a problem in the future and the Department of Health will have to spend a lot more money.</seg>
<seg id="363">Can the minister and his department and the federal government in Ottawa make funding available in 2018 to build a bigger facility than Tammaativvik that is run by the Government of Nunavut? Have you ever considered such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="364">It’s a real problem, especially for elders and those with physical disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="365">As we keep stating, we respect our elders. With that being the case, have you decided what to do about that situation?</seg>
<seg id="366">I know funding is hard to come by, but have you ever considered how to acquire a larger boarding home?</seg>
<seg id="367">As a minister, have you ever considered that with your department and the government?</seg>
<seg id="368">Can you clarify that to me?</seg>
<seg id="369">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Health, Mr. George Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="370">I very much appreciate the member’s comments and his question.</seg>
<seg id="371">With Churchill being the only boarding home that we actually run as a government, the other boarding homes that we utilize, we do on a contract basis through discussions with Health Canada and Non-Insured Health Benefits on establishing rates and contract conditions.</seg>
<seg id="372">That being said, one of the options that we are considering is looking at how to expand boarding home infrastructure here in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="373">Our options are somewhat limited, but it is a very high topic whenever we discuss with the ownership and management of Tammaativvik of how they’re going to continue to meet our growing need through the contract conditions that we have with them. It is a continual discussion.</seg>
<seg id="374">I can use Larga Baffin in Ottawa as an example where they have over the years continuously purchased and managed larger and larger facilities to continue to meet the needs of Nunavummiut going to Ottawa medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="375">We’re looking at our partners within the boarding home system along with Health Canada to see how we can continue to meet the needs of Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="376">The member brings up a very important component specifically to elders. There are limited rooms for people with mobility issues here at Tammaativvik.</seg>
<seg id="377">I guess the unfortunate reality is not only the limitation.</seg>
<seg id="378">If somebody is in that room, the boarding home management can request those people to relinquish their room for an elder, but we can’t force them to at this time. I hope everyone is listening that, if they’re put in that position, they have the respect for the elder that they would give up their room for an elder. I know I would, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">Mr. Shooyook (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also appreciate the fact this minister responds to questions, as I now understand it better.</seg>
<seg id="380">Yes, I understand the response, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="381">Nonetheless, this is a critical matter.</seg>
<seg id="382">I now ask the minister if the Tammaativvik Boarding Home is owned by a private business and that the Government of Nunavut doesn’t own it.</seg>
<seg id="383">How then do you incorporate the goals that you support when this limitation exists?</seg>
<seg id="384">Due to the importance of this issue, will this require hotel rooms?</seg>
<seg id="385">I know that funding is tight, but I wonder if the government has discussed this need with the hotel owners. Has the Department of Health contemplated purchasing another building due to the capacity issues faced by the current facility?</seg>
<seg id="386">This indeed is a very important issue, as many boarders at the facility are experiencing issues due to space limitations, particularly the sector I referenced, the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="387">How will you develop a goal to ensure, either as the Department of Health or as this government, that you don’t expend our limited funds on hotel room rentals, enriching the business owners, as is the practice today?</seg>
<seg id="388">Is this the goal of government or has the department decided on a course of action with the federal government on pursuing the funding of a larger facility?</seg>
<seg id="389">Has this been taken into consideration? I wonder if this type of idea will ever be contemplated or if this is part of your current planning.</seg>
<seg id="390">All options are on the table when we’re looking at recognizing the increasing need for boarding home services here in Iqaluit specifically.</seg>
<seg id="391">To show how serious this is, in some respects I can’t answer the member’s full question.</seg>
<seg id="392">There are negotiations that are continuously ongoing right now that we’re exploring options on how to increase capacity.</seg>
<seg id="393">Unfortunately I can’t, through procurement and any contracting, jeopardize any contracting processes, but just to let members know, it is something that’s very important that we recognize.</seg>
<seg id="394">We are working with our partners and looking at different options that we can increase capacity. We do rely a lot upon hotels.</seg>
<seg id="395">At this time it’s not in the capital plan for the Department of Health to build a new boarding home, but again, all options are being considered.</seg>
<seg id="396">That’s all I can say for now, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="397">Question 729 – 4(3): Federal Funding to Support Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="398">My questions are for the Minister of Languages.</seg>
<seg id="399">Last week the federal government announced that it has allocated $15.8 million to support and preserve Nunavut’s indigenous languages.</seg>
<seg id="400">In that announcement the federal government indicated that this funding would cover the period from 2016 to 2020, but no further details about how the funding will be spent were provided.</seg>
<seg id="401">Can the minister provide us with a breakdown of how that $15.8 million will be allocated?</seg>
<seg id="402">Hon. George Kuksuk (interpretation): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member for his question.</seg>
<seg id="403">Mr. Speaker, it’s true that the federal government made an announcement that funding will be allocated to Nunavut for languages.</seg>
<seg id="404">Mr. Speaker, in regard to my colleague’s question as to how that money will be allocated, I can say that my department and other agencies of the Nunavut government are addressing this issue through the Uqausivut Plan.</seg>
<seg id="405">We will be meeting with other departments to discuss how the money will be allocated.</seg>
<seg id="406">Your first supplementary, Mr. David Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="407">Section 13.1 of the Official Languages Act establishes the Official Languages Program Fund, which must be used to recognize and advance the equal status and rights of all Nunavut’s official languages and to develop and revitalize the Inuit language.</seg>
<seg id="408">Can the minister describe what specific expenditures were made under the Official Languages Fund during the 2016-17 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="409">As to the question of the allocation for 2016-17 and what that money will be used for, I can’t respond to that right now.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, in the Official Languages Fund report that I have, I’m sure my officials will be giving me the details of the $15.8 million and how it will be allocated.</seg>
<seg id="411">I would like to explain further about a part of his question. In speaking about the funding allocated for official languages within the authority of the Government of Nunavut, these are for French, Inuktitut, and the other official languages.</seg>
<seg id="412">This includes funding for the Inuit language.</seg>
<seg id="413">More work can be done for the Inuit language because of the availability of that funding. This will provide much support to our Inuit language and the fact that it must be recognized and used accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="414">There are many details.</seg>
<seg id="415">As per my previous statement, our department will manage this funding and it will allow us to make progress forward. Our officials will be able to provide recommendations on how to effectively implement Inuktitut or in understanding that their offices must incorporate the Inuktitut language.</seg>
<seg id="416">I am just clarifying that, as the funding is available until 2020 where, under our agreement, we will be administering the funding along with other departments.</seg>
<seg id="417">I wanted to find out what specific expenditures have been made under the Official Languages Fund.</seg>
<seg id="418">However, if the minister can respond to me, I would like to ask him if he can tell us what the balance of the Official Languages Fund was as of March 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="419">I stated earlier exactly how much funding was left as of March 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="420">Within this section related to official languages, which I don’t have the pertinent information here in front of me, I will have to return to my colleague during our sitting after retrieving the figures, and then I can provide the information.</seg>
<seg id="421">Question 730 – 4(3): Baffin Island Caribou Management (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="422">I will direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, everyone is aware that a caribou quota exists on Baffin Island, which is capped at 250 caribou for all our communities within the hunting season.</seg>
<seg id="424">Mr. Speaker, can the minister provide the information on whether the quota has been reached or how many caribou Baffin residents have harvested to date?</seg>
<seg id="425">How many caribou have been harvested out of this quota of 250 and are there still any tags available for harvesting caribou in our region?</seg>
<seg id="426">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank Mr. Keyootak for asking about caribou.</seg>
<seg id="427">There are currently 229 caribou that have been harvested by residents of Baffin Island.</seg>
<seg id="428">Since the quota is set at 250, it means that there are still 21 tags left. The season will end shortly and it will reset on July 1 as it runs from that date up to June 30.</seg>
<seg id="429">There are 21 tags available for harvesting up to June 30.</seg>
<seg id="430">Can the minister clarify which Baffin Island communities can still harvest?</seg>
<seg id="431">As the quota is almost filled, which communities have reached their quotas and which ones have not?</seg>
<seg id="432">Can the minister indicate which communities still have tags remaining to harvest caribou?</seg>
<seg id="433">Yes, I can respond to that, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="434">As of now the communities that have completed their caribou quota are Pond Inlet and Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="435">Those are the only two communities that have reached their quota.</seg>
<seg id="436">The other communities have not completed their caribou quota yet.</seg>
<seg id="437">I would like to inform them that if they don’t get all 250 caribou, then the remaining tags can be given to the communities, even to the communities that have reached their quota.</seg>
<seg id="438">I thank the minister for explaining that.</seg>
<seg id="439">Mr. Speaker, of the 250 caribou that the Baffin region can harvest for the whole year, some communities go through their quota really fast. I know some other communities don’t live near caribou populations and it takes a long time to use up their quota.</seg>
<seg id="440">For this past year I’m sure the entire 250 caribou will be caught.</seg>
<seg id="441">If the entire 250 caribou are harvested this year, will the quota remain the same next year?</seg>
<seg id="442">Yes, every year the caribou quota has been set at 250 for the Qikiqtaaluk region. Even if they don’t get all of them or get more than that, once next year comes on July 1 we will make another 250 caribou tags available.</seg>
<seg id="443">The number of 250 will not be changed until there has been another caribou survey and if they are not decreasing in population. Right now it’s going to stay at 250 tags until a further survey has been done to see if it will be increased or decreased.</seg>
<seg id="444">It will stay at 250 tags for the Qikiqtaaluk region for now.</seg>
<seg id="445">Motion 049 – 4(3): Extension of Question Period (Enook)</seg>
<seg id="446">Pursuant to our rules, I move, seconded by the Member for Gjoa Haven, to extend question period.</seg>
<seg id="447">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) There is a motion on the floor to extend question period.</seg>
<seg id="448">The motion is in order and is not subject to debate.</seg>
<seg id="449">All those in favour. (interpretation) Thank you. (interpretation ends) Opposed.</seg>
<seg id="450">(interpretation) Thank you. (interpretation ends) The motion is carried and question period is extended for an additional 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="451">(interpretation) Going back to the orders of the day. Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="452">Question 731 – 4(3): Pond Inlet Marine Facility (Enook)</seg>
<seg id="453">Today I would like to direct my questions to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="454">Before I ask the question, since we started the session on Tuesday, we have heard that we have been losing family and relatives in our communities.</seg>
<seg id="455">My family from Arviat, my cousins, I think of you and I send my condolences to you.</seg>
<seg id="456">Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up on my questions from yesterday concerning the new Pond Inlet marine facility.</seg>
<seg id="457">In her reply to one of my questions, the minister stated that… .</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Speaker, I will be quoting from the Hansard of Tuesday, May 30, 2017, page 21 in English. I know that these are unedited Hansard Blues.</seg>
<seg id="459">I will quote, “The Nunavut Impact Review Board application will be submitted by the end of April 2017.”</seg>
<seg id="460">We all know that today’s date is May 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="461">Can the minister confirm if the application has been submitted to NIRB and, if not, when is it expected to be submitted to NIRB?</seg>
<seg id="462">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="463">I also thank the member for his question in regard to this and reviewing what was stated. What I stated was from my briefing note, that the application will be submitted to NIRB.</seg>
<seg id="464">I can clearly state that the application was submitted to NIRB on May 19, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="465">Can the minister indicate what the approximate length of the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s review process is expected to be?</seg>
<seg id="466">I’ll state what’s here in English. (interpretation ends) All permitting is intended to be completed by December 2017. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="467">Can the minister confirm when the final design of the project facility will be publically released?</seg>
<seg id="468">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Hon. Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="469">The first draft designs are usually seen.</seg>
<seg id="470">It was continually amended during the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="471">Once it has been completed, the final design will be tabled in January 2018 and they will initiate a tender near the end of January.</seg>
<seg id="472">Member for Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu, Ms. Pat Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="473">Question 732 – 4(3): Tourism (Angnakak)</seg>
<seg id="474">My questions are again for the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="475">As the minister will recall, she announced in September of last year that her department would be assuming a number of roles and responsibilities that were previously held by Nunavut Tourism.</seg>
<seg id="476">As she will also recall, this was a decision that I strongly supported.</seg>
<seg id="477">Earlier this year the Legislative Assembly approved a budget increase for her department’s Tourism and Cultural Industries Division, an increase which included funding for ten new positions.</seg>
<seg id="478">As of today, what is the status of filling these ten new positions?</seg>
<seg id="479">Speaker (interpretation): Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Monica Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="480">I also thank the member for her question. I don’t have that information here with me. (interpretation ends) I will have to take that as notice.</seg>
<seg id="481">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The question has been taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="482">I’ll continue on to the next member. (interpretation) Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="483">Question 733 – 4(3): Options for Government of Nunavut Infrastructure (Enook)</seg>
<seg id="484">My questions are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="485">As the minister will recall, Nunavut Arctic College’s Ukiivik residence in Iqaluit was severely damaged by fire in the year 2015.</seg>
<seg id="486">It is my understanding that this building and the adjoining federal building warehouse are now assets of the Department of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="487">It is also my understanding that the department has been considering different options for the long-term use of both buildings, and that these options focus on converting the buildings into GN office space.</seg>
<seg id="488">Can the minister confirm what specific options are currently being considered by the government?</seg>
<seg id="489">Minister of Community and Government Services, Mr. Joe Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="490">I thank the member for the question.</seg>
<seg id="491">The Ukiivik old res. and the federal building are adjoined, but we look at them and treat them as two separate buildings and projects.</seg>
<seg id="492">Right now we are using the federal building and we are looking at maybe changing its purpose to more office space, but that is just being looked at.</seg>
<seg id="493">The old res., we’re looking at options there, whether we should demolish it, fix it up, or any other projects that could be used on it. Right now there is nothing that we have decided on for both buildings. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="494">It is my understanding that it would cost approximately $32 million to renovate and modernize the federal building warehouse and that it would cost approximately $42 million to renovate and modernize the old Nunavut Arctic College residence.</seg>
<seg id="495">Is my understanding correct?</seg>
<seg id="496">I’m not sure where those figures came from. I can’t confirm that they are correct or accurate because we have not decided what we are doing with either one of the buildings yet.</seg>
<seg id="497">Until you decide what you’re going to do with a building and what the purpose of it will be, then you can’t get a very accurate figure.</seg>
<seg id="498">No, the figures are not accurate as of right now. That’s my understanding.</seg>
<seg id="499">These are your figures, the government’s figures. Thank you for telling me that you have inaccurate figures.</seg>
<seg id="500">Minister, can you confirm if the government is actively considering consolidating its headquarters workforce into a smaller number of buildings than at present, and allowing a number of its existing office space leases to expire?</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Community and Government Services, Mr. Joe Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="502">Just to rebuttal him a little bit there, the figures may be there.</seg>
<seg id="503">I don’t know what figures he’s talking about, but until we decide on the purpose of a building, then we can’t get an accurate figure on any building.</seg>
<seg id="504">Yes, we are looking at options for office space because the member is right that we own and lease many different office buildings here in Iqaluit and lots of the government workers and departments are scattered.</seg>
<seg id="505">It would be more efficient to get each department in their own building, but as of right now we don’t have an overall plan and that’s partially to do with budgetary restraints.</seg>
<seg id="506">We are looking at all options.</seg>
<seg id="507">When a lease is up, we have an option to renew the lease, build our own, or lease another building.</seg>
<seg id="508">All that stuff is always being looked at.</seg>
<seg id="509">Question 734 – 4(3): Rankin Inlet’s Hamlet Office (Sammurtok, A)</seg>
<seg id="510">My question is to the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="511">As the minister is aware, Rankin Inlet’s hamlet office was recently assessed to determine the extent of the facility’s deterioration.</seg>
<seg id="512">During our recent winter sitting, the minister stated that his department determined that there was in fact mould present in the facility.</seg>
<seg id="513">Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that the municipality has reached out to the department for support in undertaking mould remediation at the hamlet office.</seg>
<seg id="514">Can the minister tell us what actions his department will be taking to assist the Municipality of Rankin Inlet with this mould remediation project?</seg>
<seg id="515">I can inform the member that yes, we have been talking with the hamlet with the mould problems in the municipal office there and a company did check it out and there is mould.</seg>
<seg id="516">What we’re going to do is work with the hamlet to try to remediate the mould come summer. That’s the most update I have right now to help them out with mould remediation.</seg>
<seg id="517">If that can be done, then the office will still be usable.</seg>
<seg id="518">If not, then we will look at other options.</seg>
<seg id="519">Your first supplementary, Mr. Alexander Sammurtok.</seg>
<seg id="520">During our recent winter sitting, the minister stated that his department was helping Rankin Inlet to find an alternative space for its hamlet operations while a mould remediation project is conducted.</seg>
<seg id="521">Can the minister tell us if an alternative space has been identified as of today?</seg>
<seg id="522">I myself don’t know right now whether they have an office picked out, but I believe that there is office space available in Rankin Inlet. While they do the mould remediation, we would help the hamlet out in finding alternative space. In the event that mould remediation does not work, we would also help them find alternative office space.</seg>
<seg id="523">Your final supplementary, Mr. Alexander Sammurtok.</seg>
<seg id="524">Mr. Sammurtok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="525">Mould remediation and renovations to the current facility are short-term solutions to a long-term problem, which is that the hamlet office in Rankin Inlet is aged, deteriorated, and no longer sufficient to meet the operational needs of the community’s growing population.</seg>
<seg id="526">Can the minister tell us when we can expect to see a project of construction of a new hamlet office in Rankin Inlet in the government’s capital plan?</seg>
<seg id="527">Minister of Community and Government Services, Mr. Joe Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="528">The member is correct in saying that the hamlet office in Rankin Inlet is old and it’s small.</seg>
<seg id="529">I have met there with the council and yes, they definitely have outgrown their office space.</seg>
<seg id="530">Currently it’s not in the five-year capital plan and I hope to be back here next year so that we can try to make sure we get into the community plan. Right now it’s not in there.</seg>
<seg id="531">On a side note, Rankin Inlet is getting a new arena and their old arena may be able to change its purpose for that. I’m not sure, but that’s one of the options that probably could be looked at in the interim.</seg>
<seg id="532">We’re open to all options. We know that we have to help out the Municipality of Rankin Inlet in terms of giving them adequate space.</seg>
<seg id="533">I can’t promise or commit to anything right now, but we’re there to help them.</seg>
<seg id="534">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="535">Question 735 – 4(3): Franklin Expedition (Akoak)</seg>
<seg id="536">My questions are for the Minister of Culture and Heritage.</seg>
<seg id="537">Earlier this month the federal Minister responsible for Parks Canada responded to a question asked in the House of Commons concerning the discovery of the lost ships of the Franklin Expedition.</seg>
<seg id="538">As the minister is aware, the wrecks are located in my constituency near the community of Gjoa Haven.</seg>
<seg id="539">In her response the federal minister indicated that Parks Canada is working with the Inuit Heritage Trust to “establish joint ownership of the artifacts.” She also made reference to the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="540">Mr. Speaker, can our minister clarify what role the Government of Nunavut has in this process?</seg>
<seg id="541">Minister of Culture and Heritage, Mr. George Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="542">With respect to his question regarding the discovery of the lost ships, we worked together with the federal government and other entities, especially the community of Gjoa Haven. After the discovery of the shipwrecks, we had a close working relationship with the people of Gjoa Haven.</seg>
<seg id="543">If I understood his question correctly, he is asking what role the government has in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="544">Mr. Speaker, I can indicate to the member that we have other plans to… . I’m not sure what that body of water near Gjoa Haven is called. Mr. Speaker, we are going to be responsible for the work on that body of water, getting the required permits, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="545">Whether we are working with the federal government or non-governmental organizations, the Nunavut government is going to take the leadership role in work related to the ships that have been found.</seg>
<seg id="546">As the minister is aware, the community of Gjoa Haven sees great tourism potential associated with the discovery of the Franklin Expedition ships.</seg>
<seg id="547">We want the community of Gjoa Haven to benefit from this. Can the minister describe how he is working with the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation to assist the community in this area?</seg>
<seg id="548">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Culture and Heritage, Mr. George Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="549">Hon. George Kuksuk (interpretation): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="550">The Department of Economic Development and Transportation also has other sectors which include Nunavut Tourism and cruise ships going through Nunavut waters.</seg>
<seg id="551">Mr. Speaker, the Department of Culture and Heritage could work together with the Department of Economic Development and Transportation and their tourism sector.</seg>
<seg id="552">As it relates to the findings of the ships, we can work together, but I’m not sure which divisions of our departments are going to be working on it.</seg>
<seg id="553">If there are any plans, I will discuss this with my ministerial colleague and our officials. I will be able to respond to your question in detail at a later date.</seg>
<seg id="554">Mr. Akoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As the minister is aware, there has been controversy associated with the permitting process associated with the search for the lost Franklin ships, including disputes involving the Government of Nunavut, Parks Canada, and the Arctic Research Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="555">For the record, can the minister clarify the Government of Nunavut’s position on this matter?</seg>
<seg id="556">Minister of Culture and Heritage, Mr. George Kuksuk.</seg>
<seg id="557">I can’t respond to the question at this time because there are a lot of entities involved with this matter.</seg>
<seg id="558">Question 736 – 4(3): Departmental Vacancies (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="559">Before I go to my question, I would like to welcome my teacher from Nunavut Sivuniksavut, which was established in 1985.</seg>
<seg id="560">Murray Angus was my teacher and now that he is semi-retired, I would like to welcome him to the House.</seg>
<seg id="561">(interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, my questions are for the Minister of Finance, who is the Chairperson of the Financial Management Board.</seg>
<seg id="562">The Government of Nunavut’s most recent quarterly employment report indicates that approximately 1,285 positions were vacant as of March 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="563">This represents a vacancy rate of approximately 27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="564">Ten years ago the vacancy rate was only 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="565">Can the minister indicate what specific factors have accounted for the increase in the vacancy rate?</seg>
<seg id="566">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The Hon. Minister of Finance, Mr. Keith Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="567">It’s pretty simple. The Government of Nunavut has been creating a lot of new jobs and of course we strive for 85 percent Inuit employment. People have to be qualified for those jobs and a lot of the jobs that are being created are highly technical.</seg>
<seg id="568">As Mr. Joanasie is aware, in the Berger report 2006, Berger recommended education as a key issue. The Office of the Auditor General of Canada, in their 2010 report, said the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="569">We need to get our grads up. People have to get into post-secondary and qualify for the jobs.</seg>
<seg id="570">The Government of Nunavut’s most recent quarterly employment report indicates that there were a total of approximately 4,788 positions across the entire government as of March 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="571">Ten years ago the government only had 3,687 positions.</seg>
<seg id="572">This represents an increase of over 1,100 positions, or almost 30 percent, in the span of just ten years.</seg>
<seg id="573">If the government cannot fill almost a quarter of its existing positions, why does the Financial Management Board continue to allow departments to add new positions to their organizational charts?</seg>
<seg id="574">If the entire population of Nunavut lived in one or two communities - I think it is 37,000 - it would be so much easier to provide government and public services. If you take a small town down south of 37,000 people, they’ve got a mayor, council, let’s say eight or nine people running an entire community, and maybe they’ve got a thousand employees. I’m just guessing.</seg>
<seg id="575">In Nunavut, just looking at some stats, 11 percent of our population is providing services in Nunavut. We all live in 25 communities. Twenty-five communities need health centres, one or two schools, community councils, and other services.</seg>
<seg id="576">The more communities you have and you have 37,000 people stretched across three time zones, then you have to provide the same services in those communities but not to such extent, let’s say, you have in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="577">Obviously we don’t have hospitals in Cambridge Bay or Kugluktuk. You have one here.</seg>
<seg id="578">You have to staff these positions. You can’t have one community getting all the services and other communities getting a quarter or 20 percent of the services.</seg>
<seg id="579">Mr. Speaker, the government is asked to provide services to Nunavummiut and MLAs encourage it. We work with the communities, we work with all the Nunavummiut, we prepare business cases, and the departments come to the Financial Management Board.</seg>
<seg id="580">We don’t approve everything, but then we come in this House and we debate it. The main estimates and capital estimates get approved in this House.</seg>
<seg id="581">As I noted earlier, the Government of Nunavut’s most recent quarterly employment report indicates that approximately 1,285 positions were vacant as of March 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="582">I understand the minister’s response about education is the key.</seg>
<seg id="583">In order for the population to be employed, they need to have the skills and requirements. Also looking at the vacancy rate, it can span so many years.</seg>
<seg id="584">I would like to test the minister to see if he can indicate approximately how many of the vacant positions have been sitting vacant for five years or more.</seg>
<seg id="585">Minister of Finance, Mr. Keith Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="586">I would love to be able to answer that question.</seg>
<seg id="587">As he can appreciate, I’ve got gazillions of pieces of information rolling around in my head and sometimes the answers are not immediately there.</seg>
<seg id="588">I can tell Mr. Joanasie that even though on the Inuit employment stats an indeterminate job is indicated vacant, many of those positions are filled by casuals who are not maybe providing 100 percent of the level of service in that position.</seg>
<seg id="589">They would be providing a reduced level of service.</seg>
<seg id="590">While those positions may be vacant, they’re actually quite often staffed by casuals.</seg>
<seg id="591">We put a lot of effort into it on this side, encouraging our departments to identify casuals who have been in positions for a significant length of time.</seg>
<seg id="592">It could be, let’s say for example, as long as five years. I don’t know if there are that many in there now. If a person is a casual in a position is doing a good job, they’ve had good performance appraisals, they have been learning on the job, they have gained experience, they know the job, and their boss or supervisor is satisfied with them that they’re performing well, then we actively encourage them to put forward a request for a direct appointment.</seg>
<seg id="593">Direct appointments are approved by cabinet and we quite regularly do that.</seg>
<seg id="594">My colleagues, the time for question period has expired.</seg>

<seg id="4">We’re still waiting</seg>
<seg id="5">A satellite earth station near the beach in Pangnirtung. Nunavut is still entirely dependent on expensive satellite connections for internet, mobile smartphone services, television, banking and numerous other services.</seg>

<seg id="7">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="8">We’re celebrating Nunavut’s twentieth birthday by reviewing the territory’s successes and its challenges in areas ranging from music and the visual arts to the economy, the state of Inuktut and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="9">If you’re like most internet users in Nunavut, you’re probably used to slow, expensive downloads and on-again, off-again cellphone service.</seg>
<seg id="10">You might think Nunavut was planned that way.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it wasn’t.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those who helped create the Government of Nunavut dreamed of it being accompanied by a state-of-the-art electronic communications network.</seg>
<seg id="13">“The face of the Arctic is rapidly changing, and in no area more so than in the field of electronic communications,” the Nunavut Implementation Commission declared in 1995, in its famous Footprints in New Snow report.</seg>
<seg id="14">“A significant level of computer/electronic literacy has already been attained.</seg>
<seg id="15">With proper forethought, planning, and tools, this level of electronic literacy can be expanded and deepened and corresponding economic and other benefits realized,” the commission said.</seg>
<seg id="16">At that time, the internet was a new, unfamiliar medium.</seg>
<seg id="17">A form of local dial-up internet access was available in Iqaluit through a company called Nunanet, but people in most other Nunavut communities had no affordable access.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because of this, but primarily because of the extremely high cost of satellite communications and the total absence of any land-based fibre optic lines, they also knew that creating such a network would be a tough job.</seg>
<seg id="19">“Making intelligent choices from among new communications technologies, and connecting those choices with a skillfully prepared work force, will be a major challenge of the new Nunavut Government.”</seg>
<seg id="20">Telecommunications for a decentralized government</seg>
<seg id="21">Chaired by Inuit leader John Amagoalik, the 10-member commission was handed the task of making recommendations on how a public government in Nunavut should be designed.</seg>
<seg id="22">They concluded that Nunavut’s government would need a reliable, efficient communications network to function properly.</seg>
<seg id="23">That’s because of the policy of decentralization, which sent roughly 400 mostly new government jobs to 11 of Nunavut’s smaller communities between 1999 and 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">The commission put hundreds of hours of work into studying the problem and published the results in widely distributed, but long-forgotten, supplementary reports.</seg>
<seg id="25">In one of them, Nunavut’s planning body put forward a utopian vision: a network of “teleservice centres” that would link the territory’s 25 communities.</seg>
<seg id="26">At those centres, all residents would get free or low-cost access to electronic communications equipment of all kinds—fax machines, scanners, computers and videoconference equipment.</seg>
<seg id="27">They envisioned that this system would be piggybacked upon a robust network that would connect schools, health centres, hamlet facilities and decentralized territorial offices.</seg>
<seg id="28">To show off its potential, in 1997 the commission also organized a big conference on the “nature of work” that drew delegates to Iqaluit from across the three regions that would soon make up Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the same time, they connected as many people as they could to the conference by combining every medium available to them at the time: satellite television, videoconferencing through telephone lines and satellite, fax machines, dial-up internet, and plain old voice telephone lines.</seg>
<seg id="30">That included the use of English–Inuktitut interpreters, as well as sign language interpreters and an open captioning system for the hearing impaired.</seg>
<seg id="31">“The conference organizers were aware of the risks of attempting such a technically complex format, but were firmly committed to the goal of demonstrating the potential benefits of telecommunications by pushing the limits of the current infrastructure,” organizers boasted at the time.</seg>
<seg id="32">“Several people commented on how quickly technology had been adopted in Nunavut since the days when people did not have access to even the most basic equipment like telephones and fax machines.”</seg>
<seg id="33">As we all know now, Nunavut never got there.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of facilitating a decentralized government, the weak telecommunications networks that were put in place tended to hamper government operations.</seg>
<seg id="35">In 1999, the sole territory-wide internet service available to Nunavut offered access only to governments and some private businesses, which included a few locally based internet providers.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Nunavut Broadband Development Corp., a non-profit organization, surveyed Nunavut residents and found strong demand for better internet everywhere in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="37">Using funds from Industry Canada and other sources, the broadband corporation signed a contract with the Yellowknife-based SSi Micro to offer broadband internet in every Nunavut community.</seg>
<seg id="38">That’s how the Qiniq network, which uses wireless signals in every community, came into existence in May 2005.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, every community in Nunavut had gained access to a form of affordable internet.</seg>
<seg id="40">Big wake-up call  But on Oct. 6, 2011, Nunavut residents received an abrupt wake-up call that exposed the territory’s total dependence on satellite communications.</seg>
<seg id="41">A software glitch put Telesat’s Anik F2 satellite out of commission for 16 hours, knocking out long-distance telephone, cellular, internet and automated banking services.</seg>
<seg id="42">Airlines cancelled dozens of flights, stranding thousands of passengers, and RCMP officers and territorial government officials in Iqaluit fell back on Iridium satellite telephones to reach the small communities.</seg>
<seg id="43">After that incident, governments and many other stakeholders and agencies, including the CRTC, began to take a long, hard look at the fragile state of northern Canada’s telecommunications system.</seg>
<seg id="44">Spurred by an earlier telecommunications breakdown in the summer of 2009 that hampered the Operation Nanook military exercise, a body called the Northern Communications and Information Systems Working Group did a big assessment of the communications infrastructure in the Canadian Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="45">Concerned about public safety and national security, the group recommended the setting of basic minimum standards, more reliable services, more funding, redundancy and back-up systems, and improvements to emergency response.</seg>
<seg id="46">An Ontario-based firm called Arctic Fibre Inc. emerged, proposing to install an undersea fibre optic line from New York City to Asia through the Northwest Passage, connecting multiple Nunavut communities along the way.</seg>
<seg id="47">That company was eventually acquired by Quintillion Subsea Holdings of Alaska, which did install undersea fibre optic around Arctic Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="48">But a plan to connect the Canadian Arctic has yet to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the same time, northern organizations and governments, especially the Government of Nunavut, began to make more aggressive submissions to the CRTC, demanding that the regulator do more to enforce the creation of more reliable telecommunications in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="50">“Remote isolation cannot be used as a justification for governments, businesses nor individuals being unable to access a service that is vital in today’s digital economy and that in turn provides access to other services, such as health care, education, government, public safety and banking,” the GN told the CRTC in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="51">As for the state-of-the-art telecommunications system that planners had envisioned for Nunavut, Nunavut still waits.</seg>

<seg id="1">The big thaw</seg>
<seg id="2">Over the past 20 years, Nunavut has witnessed dramatic changes as the climate warms</seg>
<seg id="3">In July 2009, swimmers head to the river to cool off in a heat wave that brought temperatures in the high twenties to Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="4">That hasn’t been typical of every summer, however.</seg>
<seg id="5">Temperatures throughout Nunavut have been up and down, in all seasons, typical of climate change, although over time Arctic average temperatures are expected to rise three times more than those globally, if warming continues unchecked.</seg>

<seg id="9">This female mountain bluebird, seen perching on a porch in Rankin Inlet on August 2018, is one of several southern bird species that have made forays into Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="10">(Photo by Putulik Photography)</seg>
<seg id="11">The first signs that Nunavut’s climate would face dramatic changes could be seen not long after those heady celebrations following the creation of the territory in April 1999.</seg>
<seg id="12">That summer, robins were first spotted nesting near the beach below the Happy Valley neighbourhood of Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="13">These robins, far outside their traditional range and numbering at least two adults and a juvenile, were seen several times near the Iqaluit cemetery and along the walking trail to Apex.</seg>
<seg id="14">By 2013, robin sightings were reported from as far away as Baker Lake, Rankin Inlet, Arviat, Cambridge Bay and Kugluktuk.</seg>
<seg id="15">These red-breasted birds, which announce the coming spring in the south, haven’t been the only winged newcomers to be spotted in Nunavut since 1999, where sightings of a mountain bluebird, a kingfisher, song sparrows and an American coot have also been recorded.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, over the past 20 years, some birds formerly common to Nunavut have become much less numerous: shorebirds like the red knot, a kind of sandpiper, have found their habitats shrink in the territory due to unusual temperature swings, new vegetation and more numerous predators—including polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="17">Warming ocean temperatures have also brought killer whales and salmon into Nunavut waters.</seg>
<seg id="18">And polar bears have become a poster species for climate change, due to concerns that the species may vanish along with the sea ice they use as a hunting platform.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nunavummiut have not always seen eye to eye with environmental groups and scientists about how polar bears are faring in a warmer Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many Inuit say that the territory’s polar bear population is healthy and will remain healthy, despite decreasing sea ice.</seg>
<seg id="21">They point to the larger numbers of polar bears now more frequently seen near and in communities, with disastrous consequences for people who cross their paths.</seg>

<seg id="24">A warmer, less predictable Arctic</seg>
<seg id="25">It remains undisputed by residents, however, that climate change is real.</seg>
<seg id="26">Temperatures are warmer throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="27">The weather is now more unpredictable, with storms blowing up unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="28">Changing water levels have made it hard to travel by boat in certain areas.</seg>
<seg id="29">The land is drier.</seg>
<seg id="30">And the ice is thinner, freezing later and melting earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Shrinking sea ice continues to set records for its dwindling extent during the summer months.</seg>
<seg id="32">And researchers say that melting permafrost in the Arctic may release more climate-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and toxins like mercury into the environment.</seg>
<seg id="33">The right to be cold</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2005, Inuk environmental activist Sheila Watt-Cloutier launched the first international legal action on climate change: a petition, also signed by 62 Inuit hunters and elders from communities across Canada and Alaska, to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Watt-Cloutier’s petition was unsuccessful, but her efforts, which garnered her a Nobel Peace Prize nomination, helped attract more global attention to climate change in the Arctic.</seg>

<seg id="40">Meanwhile, the Government of Nunavut has faced criticism for not doing more to address climate change.</seg>
<seg id="41">A report by Canada’s auditor general found in 2018 that it failed to properly assess and respond to the impacts of climate change within the territory.</seg>
<seg id="42">Other efforts to protect the Arctic have proven more effective.</seg>
<seg id="43">A treaty signed last October in Greenland, for instance, is intended to protect vulnerable fisheries in the Arctic Ocean.</seg>
<seg id="44">The agreement, signed in Ilulissat, Greenland, by representatives of Arctic nations and others, banned commercial fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean for at least the next 16 years, so scientists could try to understand the size and health of the region’s fish populations.</seg>
<seg id="45">And in August 2017, the federal government created Tallurutiup Imanga, the Inuktitut name for Lancaster Sound, the largest marine protected area in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ottawa has also invested more than $200 million in the new Canadian High Arctic Research Station in Cambridge Bay, which, when it opens, is expected to focus on climate change research.</seg>
<seg id="47">And the Inuit Circumpolar Council has been active in speaking out about climate change in the Arctic in global discussions about climate change.</seg>
<seg id="48">To cut a big contributor of warming in Nunavut and the circumpolar region, the International Maritime Organization now wants to ban heavy fuel oil from the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="49">Arctic parliamentarians and the Arctic Council are also working on a deal to limit the release of soot, or black carbon, in the Arctic.</seg>

<seg id="52">If there’s a benefit to climate change for Nunavut, it could be easier maritime access.</seg>
<seg id="53">This is likely to bring more economic activity, for resource developers, transport companies and operators of cruise ships, such as the Crystal Serenity, which, in 2017, became the largest passenger vessel to transit the Northwest Passage.</seg>
<seg id="54">University of Ottawa researcher Jackie Dawson has said you can count on shipping of all kinds in the region to continue to grow.</seg>
<seg id="55">“It may not go up in 20 years, but 20 years isn’t that long,” she told Nunatisaq News.</seg>
<seg id="56">“And it’s definitely going up in 100, unless there’s something catastrophic that happens, climatically.</seg>
<seg id="57">And when we get to that point, we will see trade through the Arctic.”</seg>

<seg id="2">The part that Inuit played in the discovery now told around the world</seg>

<seg id="7">We’re celebrating Nunavut’s twentieth birthday by reviewing the territory’s successes and its challenges in areas ranging from music and the visual arts to the economy, the state of Inuktut and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some notable Nunavummiut share with us what the territory means to them and the changes they’d like to see over the next 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">The discoveries—in 2014 and 2016—of the lost ships of Sir John Franklin’s 1845 Arctic expedition were among the most significant archaeological finds of their kind.</seg>
<seg id="10">They had eluded searchers for nearly 165 years, and it was not until late in the 20th century, when researchers finally looked back at some of the recorded Inuit testimony, which had been neglected all this time, that the solution to the mystery was found.</seg>
<seg id="11">Again and again, Inuit witnesses told those that sought them that one of the ships had sunk at Utjulik—the northwestern coast of the Adelaide Peninsula—in water shallow enough that, for a time, the masts were visible above the water.</seg>
<seg id="12">These clues, initially pursued in the 1990s by David Woodman, lay at the centre of the renewed search effort, begun by Parks Canada archaeologist Robert Grenier, along with the late Inuit historian Louie Kamookak in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nearly every summer for the next six years, the area was searched, using small skiffs towing sonar.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2014 Parks Canada decided to try searching further north in the Victoria Strait, near the ships’ last known location; ironically, it was only because of poor ice conditions there that they returned south to the Utjulik area.</seg>
<seg id="15">And it was there, on Sept. 2, 2014, that Parks Canada’s Ryan Harris saw the shadow of what proved to be HMS Erebus on his sonar screen, and uttered the now-famous phrase, “That’s it!</seg>
<seg id="16">That’s it!”</seg>
<seg id="17">The discovery resonated throughout the world, but particularly in Nunavut, where many felt that, although Parks Canada had followed the archaeological provisions of the Nunavut Act, the recovered relics were being taken south without the appropriate acknowledgement—some would say permission—of the Government of Nunavut or Inuit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="18">This early illustration depicts the departure of the Erebus and Terror from England in 1845.</seg>
<seg id="19">(File image)</seg>
<seg id="20">Disputes over ownership</seg>
<seg id="21">Disputes over the exact nature of the rules led to some rancour, with then-premier Peter Taptuna at one point writing a letter to Parks Canada demanding the return of the relics.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, although a memorandum of understanding signed in 1997 suggested that the U.K. government would cede most rights to the wrecks to Canada, the actual implementation of that agreement devolved into a lengthy and contentious process.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the midst of all this, in September of 2016, Franklin’s other ship—HMS Terror—was found in (of all places) Terror Bay, by a ship acting on information supplied by Gjoa Haven resident and Canadian Ranger Sammy Kogvik.</seg>
<seg id="24">Unlike the Erebus, which had suffered considerable damage from ice and currents, the Terror was found at a greater depth, intact to all outward appearances, even to the panes of glass on Captain Crozier’s cabin.</seg>
<seg id="25">Fortunately, through a series of deliberative processes, the Gordian knot of conflicting parties that had been tied around access to these ships gradually loosened.</seg>
<seg id="26">A Franklin Interim Advisory Committee was created, and at its recommendation, Inuit Guardians were appointed to keep each site secure.</seg>
<seg id="27">Agreements were reached with the GN, Inuit Heritage Trust and the Kitikmeot Inuit Association, such that the care and curation of all the relics would be shared between Inuit and federal agencies.</seg>
<seg id="28">Funds were allocated for an expansion of the Heritage Centre in Gjoa Haven, so that some of the recovered materials might be displayed there.</seg>
<seg id="29">The relics recovered so far have been gathered for an exhibition, “Death in the Ice,” which has appeared in Greenwich in the U.K., at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, and is presently at the Mystic Seaport Museum in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Death in the Ice exhibition, which has been touring Canada, the U.S. and the U.K., is helping to tell the story of how Inuit knowledge led to the discovery of the lost ships from Sir John Franklin’s 1845 Arctic expedition.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here, mannequins in Inuit-style sealskin parkas look over an Inuit wood carving depicting a European-style ship from about the 1500s.</seg>
<seg id="32">(Photo by Steve Ducharme)</seg>
<seg id="33">Controversy ends in consensus</seg>
<seg id="34">Finally, an agreement was negotiated whereby, in return for the relics so far recovered from HMS Erebus, the U.K. government now waives any right to material remaining on either vessel.</seg>
<seg id="35">So what began in controversy has ended in consensus—and certainly, the discovery of these two legendary ships will now bring considerable benefits to Nunavummiut, both those in the communities nearest the wreck, but also collectively to all.</seg>
<seg id="36">The increased travel to the region by passengers on expedition cruises, many of which are built around the widespread historical fascination with the Franklin story, will surely bring both revenue and increased understanding.</seg>
<seg id="37">Most importantly of all, the story of the Inuit role in the discovery of both vessels is being told around the world, not only through the Death in the Ice exhibition (which will move on to Alaska this summer for the final leg of its journey), but through the interpretative and teaching materials that have been born of the collaboration between the federal and territorial governments.</seg>
<seg id="38">When the long-hoped-for Nunavut archive and museum is finally a reality, all the items from this ongoing archaeological work—along with a vast array of material that’s been in storage since 1999—will come together to tell the broader story of Inuit people, of which the story of the Franklin expedition—dramatic though it is—represents in fact only a small part.</seg>
<seg id="39">It’s thanks to the historical Inuit testimony recorded more than a century ago—along with the traditional knowledge and history still preserved by Inuit today—that this will be possible.</seg>

<seg id="6">We’re celebrating Nunavut’s twentieth birthday by reviewing the territory’s successes and its challenges in areas ranging from music and the visual arts to the economy, the state of Inuktut and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">If there was an expectation in 1999 that Inuit in the eastern Arctic would consider the new territory of Nunavut as “our land” and remain in the North, that was wrong: after the territory’s creation, an increasing number of Nunavummiut picked up and headed south.</seg>
<seg id="8">Today, 20 years later, the number of Inuit who call Ottawa home, by some estimates, sits at close to 5,000.</seg>
<seg id="9">But, in 1999, the Inuit population of Ottawa still numbered in the hundreds.</seg>
<seg id="10">No one seemed to realize that over the next 20 years Ottawa’s Inuit population would rival that of many communities in Nunavut and that it would be hard to find Nunavummiut without at least one family member living in Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="11">Annie Pisuktie, the secretary of the Southern Quebec Inuit Association, who originally comes from Nunavut, tells the Viens commission last year about the many needs of Montreal’s Inuit population.</seg>
<seg id="12">The commission looked into how Quebec government programs have served the province’s Indigenous peoples.</seg>
<seg id="13">(Screenshot)</seg>
<seg id="14">The departure of so many Inuit from Nunavut for the south has led to the growth of a much larger support network for Inuit from Nunavut and other Inuit Nunangat regions in Ottawa and other cities across Canada, including St. John’s, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Edmonton.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, from 2006 to 2016 the number of Inuit living outside Inuit Nunangat grew from 10,920 to 17,690.</seg>
<seg id="16">Not all those Inuit came from Nunavut, but over that 10-year period there was a jump of 62 per cent in the Inuit population outside Inuit Nunangat.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2016 report from the Ottawa-based Tungasuvvingat Inuit also reveals that between 2001 and 2006 the numbers of Inuit had already increased by 30 per cent in Toronto and by 60 per cent in Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="18">TI’s Urban Inuit Strategy report found Inuit were mainly drawn to the south by opportunities for employment, housing, medical care and education.</seg>
<seg id="19">TI’s 2016 findings about southern Inuit also revealed the following:</seg>
<seg id="20">• Only three in 10 Inuit planned to return to their communities of origin.</seg>
<seg id="21">• Nearly nine in 10 urban Inuit were first-generation urban residents.</seg>
<seg id="22">• Fewer than half felt that Aboriginal political organizations did a good job representing their interests.</seg>
<seg id="23">With the growth of the Inuit population in Ottawa, TI, now in its third decade, started to step up its services.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only three years after Nunavut’s creation, in 2002, TI held a community gathering in the hope of broadening its mandate to a provincial level. As a result, TI was recognized as a provincial organization for Inuit in Ontario.</seg>
<seg id="25">Then, in 2005, three years after that first provincial gathering, TI hosted the One Voice conference, which brought Inuit together from seven cities across Canada to share stories about living away from home.</seg>

<seg id="29">Since 1999, Inuit organizations have also stayed put in Ottawa: ITK, the Inuit Circumpolar Council and Pauktuutit Inuit Women’s Association remain in the city, where they employ many Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Ottawa Inuit Children’s Centre now has numerous programs for children, youth and families, while the Ottawa-based college for young Nunavut Inuit students, Nunavut Sivuniksavut, has also expanded.</seg>
<seg id="31">As well, many educated Nunavummiut, whose ranks include the only Nunavut Inuit heart surgeon, accountant and crown prosecutor, have chosen not to relocate the territory.</seg>
<seg id="32">They’re just a few of the Nunavut Inuit in this Arctic diaspora, diaspora being a term used to describe the dispersion of any people from their original homeland.</seg>
<seg id="33">Some of the social problems, such as homelessness, addictions and violence which many Nunavummiut wished to escape also followed them.</seg>
<seg id="34">These have resulted in several tragic incidents, such as the recent death of Susan Kuplu-Irqittuq in Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some jurisdictions in the south have also been slow to step up to meet the needs of Nunavut Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="36">Last year, Annie Pisuktie, the secretary of the Southern Quebec Inuit Association, who originally comes from Nunavut, told the Viens commission into how Quebec has served its Indigenous peoples about the pressing needs of Montreal’s Inuit population for shelter, treatment and other support.</seg>

<seg id="39">Not only did the crystal balls of Nunavut’s founders fail to show the departure of many Inuit from the territory, they also failed to predict the migration of hundreds of well-trained immigrants and their families to the Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="40">These new arrivals include professionals from as far away as the Philipines, Zimbabwe, India and Nigeria—who have been ready to trade southern Canada for Nunavut, where they have set up their own support networks, with associations for African-Caribbean residents and a mosque for Iqaluit Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="41">The result: a much more multicultural, diverse Nunavut than anyone predicted, with the visible minority population in the territory standing at 2.5 per cent, that is, about 1,000 residents and double that of five years ago.</seg>

<seg id="2">“Reliable access to housing is foundational to Inuit health and well-being”</seg>
<seg id="3">ITK President Natan Obed and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau co-chair the Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee’s latest meeting in Ottawa April 3, which included the release of a new Inuit housing strategy.</seg>

<seg id="5">By Sarah Rogers</seg>
<seg id="6">The Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee released a new housing strategy this week, calling for more stable government investment, made directly to Inuit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="7">The partnership committee, co-chaired by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami President Natan Obed, met on Wednesday, April 3 in Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new strategy highlights the urgent need for adequate housing across Inuit Nunangat, where over half of Inuit live in overcrowded housing, and where the vast majority of communities do not have a safe shelter for women and children experiencing family violence.</seg>
<seg id="9">The report also notes that efforts to eliminate tuberculosis in Inuit Nunangat by 2030 will only succeed if housing outcomes across the North improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Although significant, direct Inuit housing investments have been made by the federal government in recent years, the delivery of these funds has posed a number of challenges,” the strategy reads.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Direct funding announced in [recent budgets] have been slow to reach Inuit, resulting in housing delivery delays that erode the overall effectiveness of these investments.</seg>
<seg id="12">Significant, multi-year advanced planning and preparation is required for the construction of housing in Inuit communities.”</seg>
<seg id="13">The 2017 federal budget announced $240 million for housing in Nunavut over a 10-year period, while the 2018 budget promised $400 million over 10 years for housing in Nunatsiavut, Nunavik and the Inuvialuit settlement region.</seg>
<seg id="14">To ensure the lasting impact of those investments, the new strategy says Inuit must be directly involved in both the delivery of funding as well as in housing-related decision making.</seg>
<seg id="15">While recent housing budgets were directed to some regional Inuit organizations, like Makivik Corp. in Nunavik, the Nunatsiavut government and the Inuvialuit Regional Corp., the report noted that no direct investments were made to Inuit organizations in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="16">Other calls for action included in the new housing strategy include:</seg>
<seg id="17">• A need for direct access to long term, multi-year, stable housing investments to ensure improvements to Inuit Nunangat housing, based on direct Inuit access and Inuit self-determination.</seg>
<seg id="18">• A regional needs assessment in year one of the implementation of the strategy, or as soon as practical, to develop a baseline and to better target investments to diverse regional needs.</seg>
<seg id="19">• Housing programs and initiatives that support alternative housing options, the reduction of barriers to increasing alternative housing options and improving affordability, including energy efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="20">• A labour force and skills needs assessment, with the goal of supporting Inuit filling jobs in the housing industry.</seg>
<seg id="21">• Communication and engagement with provincial and territorial governments in the implementation of the Inuit Nunangat Housing Strategy</seg>
<seg id="22">“Reliable access to housing is foundational to Inuit health and well-being,” said ITK president Natan Obed in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="23">“The collaboration with the federal government on the National Inuit Housing Strategy which is being released today seeks to improve housing conditions across Inuit Nunangat and ensure better outcomes through greater Inuit self-determination and control.”</seg>
<seg id="24">In the same release, Trudeau said his government was committed to finding “community-owned, community-driven solutions,” as outlined in the new housing strategy.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can read the full housing strategy in English or Inuktitut on ITK’s website.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee was created in February 2017 with the signing of the Inuit Nunangat Declaration on Inuit-Crown Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="27">This was the group’s third meeting this year.</seg>
<seg id="28">In recent months, the group has also endorsed the Inuit Tuberculosis Elimination Framework—its plan to eradicate TB among Inuit by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="29">The committee has also co-developed the Indigenous Early Learning and Childcare Framework, which outlines the needs for care and education for Inuit children and youth.</seg>
<seg id="30">The committee says it has now begun to look to new areas of focus this year, including efforts to address infrastructure gaps in Inuit Nunangat.</seg>

<seg id="8">The Canadian Arctic is facing tremendous ecological upheaval as the planet heats up, experiencing rates of warming two to three times faster than the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Though the Arctic alone cannot save itself from the chaos of climate change, increasingly Canada has been giving federal protection to key parts of the Arctic in the hope of preserving wilderness and wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="10">And, with the creation of a new national marine conservation area in the High Arctic, it’s hoped that Inuit hunting traditions will be protected as well.</seg>
<seg id="11">For decades, non-governmental organizations and Inuit groups have been fighting to protect the waters of Tallurutiup Imanga, or Lancaster Sound.</seg>
<seg id="12">“This is one of the most biologically diverse areas in the whole of the Arctic,” explains Megan Leslie, CEO of World Wildlife Fund Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">Seventy-five per cent of the world’s narwhals can be found in these waters.</seg>
<seg id="14">Polar bears hunt blubbery seals from the sea ice. And seabirds flock here in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tallurutiup Imanga is also located within the Last Ice Area, the area where summer sea ice is expected to persist the longest in the face of climate change, providing refuge to imperilled species.</seg>
<seg id="16">Photographer Andrew Tagak took this photo on April 5 of sunlight on snow and hoodoos in Sirmilik National Park on Bylot Island, Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">(Photo by Andrew Tagak)</seg>
<seg id="18">In 2010, the government proposed protecting 44,500 square kilometers of the sound in a national marine conservation area.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the number disappointed environmental advocates and the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, who wanted to see a much larger area set aside.</seg>
<seg id="20">After another seven years of negotiations, and the relinquishment of 30 Shell oil and gas exploration leases in the region, the government announced they had struck a deal to expand the protection to a 131,000 square-kilometre area.</seg>
<seg id="21">The inclusion of Tallurutiup Imanga will more than double the size of protected areas in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="22">The waters of Tallurutiup Imanga are of vital importance to many Inuit who hunt seals and whales in the sound.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nunavut’s existing protected areas are managed by Parks Canada with the help of advisory committees that funnel feedback from Inuit communities to the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="24">But with Tallurutiup Imanga, Inuit are hoping for a larger share of responsibility in managing the marine conservation area.</seg>
<seg id="25">“We’re negotiating to try and gain more Inuit control over management,” says Sandra Inutiq, chief negotiator for the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="26">The association hopes to establish a co-management body with Parks Canada, as well as an Indigenous guardian program.</seg>
<seg id="27">“I think it’s an evolution of how conservation is being thought about,” says Inutiq.</seg>
<seg id="28">“We’re starting to appreciate the Indigenous approach to conservation more…. The value that underlies our culture, and hunting culture, is very much conservation-minded.”</seg>

<seg id="31">Guardians out on the land, she says, should be able to hunt and monitor the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the 20 years since the creation of Nunavut, more than 100,000 square kilometres have been placed under protection in Nunavut in the form of five national parks.</seg>
<seg id="33">Two of these parks—Auyuittuq and Quttinirpaaq— had existed as national park reserves since 1976 and 1988 respectively, but the Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement allowed for the regions to become fully gazetted under Canada’s National Parks Act in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sirmilik, which falls within the Arctic cordillera, joined them.</seg>
<seg id="35">The federal government has since established two more national parks in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="36">On the northwestern shores of Hudson Bay lies Ukkusiksalik National Park, meaning “place where there is stone to carve pots and oil lamps.” Inuit have hunted here since time immemorial, and early Thule and Dorset cultures made use of the land thousands of years ago.</seg>
<seg id="37">The area was formally recognized in 2014, bringing more than 20,000 square kilometres of tundra and Canadian Shield under federal protection.</seg>
<seg id="38">Qausuittuq National Park followed in 2015, becoming the country’s 45th national park.</seg>

<seg id="40">Qausuittuq, which is located in the northern part of Bathurst Island and Governor General Islands, fit the bill.</seg>

<seg id="45">“One of the reasons the park was created is that it was identified as important habitat for Peary caribou,” explains Andrew Maher, Parks Canada field unit superintendent for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="46">Peary caribou, the smallest of all caribou subspecies, are listed as endangered under the Species at Risk Act.</seg>
<seg id="47">Over the last three generations, scientists estimate Peary caribou populations have declined by about 72 percent in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="48">“The Arctic, globally, is very well represented in terms of protected areas,” says Jenna Boon, a negotiator with Parks Canada’s protected areas establishment and conservation directorate.</seg>
<seg id="49">“The Arctic is of high interest to Parks Canada because there are not many places in the south that have vast tracts of land that may be looked at for protection and conservation purposes.”</seg>
<seg id="50">Boon adds that over the last 20 years, the government has made progress in embracing cooperative management in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="51">“We’ve shifted our paradigm, in a sense … embracing the desire to work with other stakeholders, rights holders, and Indigenous people.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Inuit Nunangat Housing Strategy offers little hope</seg>
<seg id="2">“No one makes any concrete commitment to spend any money, perform any actions or build any houses”</seg>
<seg id="3">Social housing units under construction in Kuujjuaq in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="5">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="6">It’s not hard to understand why, after throwing it out into the world last week, they fled the scene under the protective cover of a late evening press release and a barrage of fawning Facebook selfies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The stench of futility given off by the Inuit Nunangat Housing Strategy, “co-developed” by the Government of Canada and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and released this past April 3, is so strong it’s hard to blame its creators for doing a dump-and-run.</seg>
<seg id="8">If you don’t trust that judgment, we’ve embedded a copy of the strategy at the bottom of this editorial so you can read it for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="9">You’ll see that within the document, which bears the logos of Canada and ITK, no one makes any concrete commitment to spend any money, perform any actions or build any houses.</seg>
<seg id="10">If this were some other issue, it wouldn’t matter.</seg>
<seg id="11">Governments and quasi-government organizations often emit policy documents that nobody reads and nobody acts on.</seg>
<seg id="12">But housing is not a trivial issue.</seg>
<seg id="13">Northern Canada’s severe housing shortage sits at the centre of a grave humanitarian crisis, linked to deteriorating mental health, poor outcomes in school and recent frightening outbreaks of tuberculosis and other communicable diseases.</seg>
<seg id="14">The housing strategy acknowledges that, of course, and gathers together various assemblages of other long-recognized facts that, while valid, have been repeated so often that they’re now turning into tiresome clichés.</seg>
<seg id="15">What it does not offer is any hope for the future, especially in Nunavut, which suffers from the highest proportion of Inuit living in overcrowded homes (56.4 per cent), the highest proportion of Inuit living in homes that require repairs (34.3 per cent), and the highest number of total units required to meet the existing housing shortfall (3,500, at an estimated capital cost of $1.7 billion).</seg>
<seg id="16">Vague platitudes</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, the federal government and on the four regional Inuit organizations heap praise upon themselves for things they did between 2016 and 2018.</seg>
<seg id="18">But for the future, they offer vague platitudes and not much else.</seg>
<seg id="19">Take, for example, one of the lesser-known but more serious aspects of the housing crisis: the skyrocketing cost of operating and maintaining existing stocks of social housing.</seg>
<seg id="20">Late last month, Terry Audla, the president of the Nunavut Housing Corp., told the Baffin region’s mayors that the cost of maintaining and operating a single social housing unit in Nunavut now averages $26,700 a year.</seg>
<seg id="21">This means that if the NHC were a private landlord, it would be required to charge an annual average rent of at least $2,200 a month, and likely more, just to break even.</seg>
<seg id="22">Those staggering costs, which include fuel, power, garbage pickup, water and sewage and building maintenance, aren’t news by the way.</seg>
<seg id="23">They’ve been known for years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the territories, the governments of Nunavut and the Northwest Territories have been getting an annual subsidy from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. to help cover them.</seg>
<seg id="25">But that subsidy contains a poisoned pill.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 2004, that subsidy has been slowly shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="27">And by 2037, it will have shrunk to zero.</seg>
<seg id="28">The strategy acknowledges this, and says what everyone in the field has known for years, that declining operation and maintenance funds will cause territorial housing agencies “to direct more of their own funding to existing units as opposed to building much needed new ones.”</seg>
<seg id="29">The strategy’s solution, however, is vacuous, to say the least: “However, it is expected that through bilateral agreements to be in place in 2019, provincial and territorial governments will commit to preserve and expand the number of community housing units in their respective jurisdiction.”</seg>
<seg id="30">What agreements?</seg>
<seg id="31">Between who and whom?</seg>
<seg id="32">Given that provincial and territorial governments are not parties to the Inuit Nunangat Housing Strategy, and that these “agreements” haven’t been signed yet, this claim must be treated with the utmost skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="33">No clear commitment to build</seg>
<seg id="34">OK.</seg>
<seg id="35">We’ve bored you long enough about evaporating O&M funds.</seg>
<seg id="36">Let’s turn to the questions that matter most to those who don’t have housing.</seg>
<seg id="37">How many more units?</seg>
<seg id="38">Where and when will they be built?</seg>
<seg id="39">On that point, the strategy heaps lavish praise on the Liberal government and on Inuit organizations for their recent construction commitments—even if none of them have ever seen a credible third-party evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="40">These projects, using federal dollars committed in the 2016 and 2018 Liberal budgets, have produced 144 units in Nunavik built by Makivik Corp.’s in-house construction firm, 24 units built in Nunatsiavut by the Nunatsiavut government, and 15 units in the Inuvialuit settlement area.</seg>
<seg id="41">It does contain one interesting idea: that Inuit organizations may get involved directly in housing construction and in the management of housing. That’s a refreshing change of attitude.</seg>
<seg id="42">But what will they do in the future?</seg>
<seg id="43">On that, the housing strategy, unfortunately, offers little more than fog and obfuscation.</seg>
<seg id="44">In Nunavut, for example, the strategy admits that past Liberal spending commitments on social housing construction—$76.7 million over two years starting in 2016, and $240 million over 10 years starting in 2017—fall far short of what is required.</seg>
<seg id="45">So the strategy’s authors tell us Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. and the three regional associations in Nunavut want to create an “Inuit designed and delivered, long term affordable housing program.”</seg>
<seg id="46">The strategy says this would encourage homeownership and “complement” the housing corporation’s current offerings.</seg>
<seg id="47">So who would pay to construct these “Inuit designed and delivered” housing units and how much would they pay?</seg>
<seg id="48">No answer.</seg>
<seg id="49">How many of these units would the Inuit organizations build and where would they build them?</seg>
<seg id="50">No answer.</seg>
<seg id="51">Who would subsidize their operation and maintenance costs?</seg>
<seg id="52">No answer.</seg>
<seg id="53">The strategy does say the Inuit-run housing program in Nunavut would involve a combination of private financing and a “complementary allocation” from government, without specifying which government.</seg>
<seg id="54">But don’t hold your breath.</seg>
<seg id="55">This is not a commitment that any thoughtful person ought to trust.</seg>
<seg id="56">Meanwhile, the Liberal government led by His Esteemed Awesomeness, Saint Justin of Papineau, is headed for an ignominious defeat. The departure of two of that government’s most respected ministers, Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, coupled with Trudeau’s incompetent, mendacious response to Canada’s worse political scandal in at least two decades, has, in the eyes of many Canadians, destroyed his credibility and moral authority.</seg>
<seg id="57">National opinion polls, including CBC’s poll tracker, suggest that if an election were held right now, Andrew Scheer’s Conservative party would, at the very least, form a minority government, with the New Democratic Party holding the balance of power.</seg>
<seg id="58">That means last week’s dubious housing strategy, along with other more substantial products of the Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee, now sit on a shaky foundation anyway.</seg>
<seg id="59">The Inuit organizations who participate in that process should put away their souvenir selfies with Saint Justin and start building bridges with NDP and Conservative leaders.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut children still suffer from botched communications, watchdog says</seg>
<seg id="2">Outgoing representative for children and youth appears at legislative hearing</seg>
<seg id="3">Sherry McNeil-Mulak, Nunavut’s outgoing Representative for Children and Youth, in an appearance before the legislative assembly’s standing committee on oversight of government operations and public accounts, where she answered questions about her annual reports from the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her five-year term expires this June.</seg>

<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">Nunavut children who need services still suffer from continuing weaknesses at the Department of Family Services and a serious lack of coordination among the Government of Nunavut departments responsible for providing those services, Nunavut’s child and youth rights watchdog told MLAs April 10.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sherry McNeil-Mulak, Nunavut’s outgoing representative for children and youth, delivered that assessment to members of the legislative assembly’s standing committee on oversight of government operations and public accounts, where she appeared as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="9">“We have grown extremely concerned about weaknesses in the current system,” she said in her opening remarks, referring to the Department of Family Services’ level of support for children and youth.</seg>
<seg id="10">The legislative committee, on Wednesday, April 10, started two days of televised hearings.  Today, another officer of the legislative assembly, Elaine Keenan-Bengts, Nunavut’s information and privacy commissioner, will appear at the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kids caught in bureaucratic snafus</seg>
<seg id="12">The child and youth representative’s 2017-18 annual report says Family Services generated 72 per cent of the “individual advocacy” cases that her office worked on during that fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Individual advocacy” means work aimed at helping a child or youth get services from government workers, and is often done to sort out bureaucratic screw-ups that leave kids in the lurch.</seg>
<seg id="14">This kind of work represents a growing part of the youth representative office’s work.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Since opening, our office has worked on 200 individual advocacy cases, and we are concerned that no tangible improvements have been made to address this major barrier,” McNeil-Mulak’s 2017-18 report said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another disturbing statistic is that 68 per cent of those Family Service matters involve youth protection.</seg>
<seg id="17">The second biggest number of individual advocacy cases in 2017-18—31 per cent—involved the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="18">This includes problems gaining access to mental health and specialist services, oral health, and problems afflicting young people receiving out-of-territory care.</seg>
<seg id="19">And 27 per cent of cases involved the Department of Education.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, many cases involve multiple departments.</seg>
<seg id="21">Also, McNeil-Mulak told MLAs that many of these cases are brought to her office by frustrated GN workers who run into roadblocks when they try to help kids with problems.</seg>
<seg id="22">“There is a lot of frustration felt by frontline service providers,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Iqaluit-Manirajak MLA Adam Arreak Lightstone said he is surprised to see that sexual abuse isn’t mentioned much in the children and youth representative’s annual report.</seg>
<seg id="24">(Screen grab)</seg>
<seg id="25">DEA decision breached child’s education rights</seg>
<seg id="26">In one egregious case cited in the agency’s 2017-18 annual report, a troubled child lost more than two months of time at school because of multi-faceted communication screw-ups involving a district education authority, a school, a community social worker, and mental health workers.</seg>
<seg id="27">The child, a ward of Family Services, “exhibited suicidal ideation” while on school property.</seg>
<seg id="28">(“Suicidal ideation” means suicidal thoughts.)</seg>
<seg id="29">The child received a partial psychiatric assessment, but it wasn’t completed.</seg>
<seg id="30">At the same time, the DEA said the child could not go back to school until that assessment was done.</seg>
<seg id="31">That position by the DEA violated the child’s right to an education, the child and youth advocacy office found.</seg>
<seg id="32">The child advocate corrected that by arranging for the school to give the child take-home learning materials, but the psychiatric assessment was delayed even longer by problems involving the community social worker and the social worker’s supervisor.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the end, it took more than two months to get the mess sorted out.</seg>
<seg id="34">“All involved service providers were encouraged to improve their communication in order to properly coordinate services,” the report said.</seg>
<seg id="35">High staff turnover, staff shortages</seg>
<seg id="36">Arviat North-Whale Cove MLA John Main, the chair of the committee, asked McNeil-Mulak near the end of the meeting, in relation to the communication problems that affect child youth services, to specify “who is not talking to whom.”</seg>
<seg id="37">McNeil-Mulak replied by saying it occurs everywhere within the GN.</seg>
<seg id="38">“The communication barriers exist throughout the entirety of government,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="39">As for continuing weaknesses at the Department of Family Service, the department’s deputy minister, Yvonne Niego, said the department still suffers from high staff turnover and staff shortages.</seg>
<seg id="40">The high turnover means that many employees haven’t learned about who they are allowed to talk to, who they can share information with, and who else provides services for children.</seg>
<seg id="41">And McNeil-Mulak told MLAs it’s clear that Family Services staff, especially community social service workers, are overworked and overwhelmed.</seg>
<seg id="42">“We see a tremendous burden place on the social services workforce,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="43">Niego said Family Services experienced a lot of instability after it was hived off from the Department of Health in 2013 and set up as a standalone department.</seg>
<seg id="44">That included a succession of multiple deputy ministers and multiple ministers.</seg>
<seg id="45">“We’re trying to build stability into the department,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Yvonne Niego, the deputy minister of the Department of Family Services, said she’s trying to bring some stability to the department, which has seen multiple deputy ministers and multiple ministers after being hived off from the Department of Health in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="47">(Screen grab)</seg>
<seg id="48">Sexual abuse a priority for Family Services</seg>
<seg id="49">Another area that Niego, a former RCMP officer, considers a priority is the sexual abuse of children.</seg>
<seg id="50">She made those remarks after Iqaluit-Manirajak MLA Adam Arreak Lightstone said he’s surprised that the sexual abuse of children didn’t get mentioned in McNeil-Mulak’s presentation.</seg>
<seg id="51">Main also asked a similar question.</seg>
<seg id="52">“This topic I would consider one of my specialty areas,” Niego replied.</seg>
<seg id="53">Referring to a message that McNeil-Mulak repeated many times, Niego said that when dealing with sexual abuse service providers must listen to children.</seg>
<seg id="54">“We totally agree on listening to the voice of youth.</seg>
<seg id="55">This is important,” Niego said.</seg>
<seg id="56">And that’s because abused children are often not believed in their home communities.</seg>
<seg id="57">“I do not have faith in our communities’ ability to hear children,” Niego said.</seg>
<seg id="58">For that reason, and because many abused children do not know how to articulate what is happening to them, “everyone should be attuned to the signs and symptoms of sexual abuse,” Niego said.</seg>
<seg id="59">McNeil-Mulak said her office is planning to submit a report, based on a systemic review of mental health issues, to the GN later this year.</seg>
<seg id="60">She said that report will contain 15 recommendations, and make references to sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="61">Children’s rights alien to Inuit?</seg>
<seg id="62">During the all-day session, some MLAs suggested the concept of promoting children’s rights, a message that McNeil-Mulak stressed throughout the day, is alien to Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="63">“As an Inuk, it is something that is foreign to me,” Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet MLA Cathy Towtongie said of the idea of children’s rights.</seg>
<seg id="64">And referring to the four GN departments represented at the hearing—Family Services, Health, Education and Justice—Towtongie said they too represent alien systems.</seg>
<seg id="65">“I don’t see any of these systems reflecting our ancient culture,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="66">Aggu MLA Paul Quassa also expressed some discomfort with the idea of children’s rights.</seg>
<seg id="67">“Children have to be treated like children… These days people are trying to counsel them like little adults,” Quassa said.</seg>
<seg id="68">And Baker Lake MLA Simeon Mikkungwak asked a blunt question: “How does your office deal with spoiled brats?”</seg>
<seg id="69">McNeil-Mulak responded by saying her office doesn’t get involved in private family matters.</seg>
<seg id="70">After Mikkungwak clarified his question by saying he was thinking of children who bully other children, Niego said such behavior is likely a sign of other problems in the child’s life.</seg>
<seg id="71">McNeil-Mulak, who was appointed to the position on June 2, 2014, will finish her five-year term in June of this year.</seg>
<seg id="72">She told MLAs that the agency, which is an office the legislature, needs two more staff members: a person able to lead investigations of child deaths and serious injuries, and a person capable of leading “systemic advocacy” on child and youth rights issues.</seg>
<seg id="73">The legislative assembly has already begun to advertise for another Nunavut children and youth representative, but they have yet to name McNeil-Mulak’s successor.</seg>
<seg id="74">The office was created in 2014, after the legislative assembly had passed the Representative for Children and Youth Act in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="75">That followed years of lobbying, starting in the early 2000s by the former Cambridge Bay mayor and MLA, Keith Peterson, and others.</seg>

<seg id="2">FANS is reviewing its living allowance, which hasn’t change in over a decade</seg>

<seg id="6">Nunatsiaq News partnered with Nunavut Sivuniksavut in Ottawa this past winter to deliver a journalism workshop to a group of first- and second-year students.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some of our reporters and editors spent Wednesday afternoons working with three students, who pitched and reported their own news and feature stories.</seg>
<seg id="8">It can be hard to make ends meet when you’re a post-secondary student from Nunavut, studying in southern Canada.</seg>
<seg id="9">Delilah Amarualik knows that struggle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Originally from Pond Inlet, Amarualik is a first-year student at Nunavut Sivuniksavut in Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="11">She’s also the single mother of a two-year-old daughter.</seg>
<seg id="12">Delilah Amarualik, a first-year student at Nunavut Sivuniksavut, and her two-year daughter Athena.</seg>
<seg id="13">(Photo courtesy of Dayna Bruce)  Like most post-secondary students, Amarualik relies on funding through the Financial Assistance for Nunavut Students (FANS) program, administered by the Government of Nunavut’s Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="14">Amarualik receives a $1,600-per-month living allowance through the program.</seg>
<seg id="15">But after she pays her $750 monthly rent, food and phone bill, she says she often doesn’t have enough to make it through until the end of the month.</seg>
<seg id="16">“After I get paid from FANS, I ask my family for money most times,” Amarualik said.</seg>
<seg id="17">“I had a really hard time the first semester,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="18">“I called FANS and they couldn’t put [my monthly allowance] higher.”</seg>
<seg id="19">Following the Christmas holidays, Amarualik found herself so cash-poor she didn’t have enough money for groceries.</seg>
<seg id="20">In early January, Amarualik posted on Facebook, asking for family and friends for help to get diapers for her toddler.</seg>
<seg id="21">Over the 2018-2019 academic year, FANS received applications from every Nunavut community except for Grise Fiord.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are roughly 480 Nunavummiut students who will use FANS’ $7 million annual grant budget this year.</seg>
<seg id="23">FANS program statistics for 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="24">(Data courtesy of FANS)</seg>
<seg id="25">As of April 2019, 47 of those are enrolled in Nunavut Sivuniksavut. FANS will spend more than $850,000 on NS students’ funding this year.</seg>
<seg id="26">FANS’ basic grant covers tuition fees up to $6,855 a year, plus a base living allowance of $1,092.</seg>
<seg id="27">It offers up to $2,600 a month for students with dependents or other special needs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even students without dependents say that the living allowance is hardly enough to get by on each month, let alone have any spending money for weekend outings or a meal out.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many post-secondary students from Nunavut relocate to southern cities to pursue their studies, but say they don’t have the budget to fully enjoy that experience.</seg>
<seg id="30">In some cases, students can take on part-time work to supplement their income, though by no more than $900 a month if they want to remain eligible for FANS.</seg>
<seg id="31">Nunavut Sivuniksavut asks its students not to work, however, so they can focus on their studies and the cultural performance aspect of the program.</seg>
<seg id="32">FANS administrators acknowledge that its living allowance hasn’t increased in about a decade, and hasn’t been able to keep up with the cost of living in most Canadian cities where Nunavut students move to study.</seg>
<seg id="33">Dayna Bruce is a first-year student at Nunavut Sivuniksavut.</seg>
<seg id="34">(Submitted photo)</seg>
<seg id="35">But that could change soon.</seg>
<seg id="36">Rob Clift, the director of career development at Nunavut’s Department of Family Services, which oversees FANS, said the program is currently under review.</seg>
<seg id="37">“We all know it needs to be improved,” Clift said.</seg>
<seg id="38">“If you want people to be able to concentrate on their studies, you have to give them enough money, so they don’t have to worry about rent and food and other things,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="39">The department is putting together a business case and will make recommendations to the legislative assembly this summer—one of which will be to increase students’ monthly allowances.</seg>
<seg id="40">“The biggest challenge is the support we provide to students,” Clift said.</seg>
<seg id="41">“It’s not reasonable to assume that students from Nunavut have access to additional resources in the same way as students from the south does.</seg>
<seg id="42">It’s just not like that.”</seg>
<seg id="43">If it’s approved, Clift hopes that increased allowance will be in place for September 2020.</seg>
<seg id="44">“This is a way for the territory to build the professional workforce that it needs,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">“It’s often not thought of, ‘This is actually part of the Nunavut project.’”</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut struggles to recruit Inuit health-care workers</seg>
<seg id="2">Half of the Department of Health’s employees are Inuit, though only a handful work in front-line care</seg>
<seg id="3">By Leanna Wilson and Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunatsiaq News partnered with Nunavut Sivuniksavut in Ottawa this past winter to deliver a journalism workshop to a group of first- and second-year students.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some of our reporters and editors spent Wednesday afternoons working with three students, who pitched and reported their own news and feature stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">Art Sateana can recall the first time he felt out of place as a patient in Nunavut’s health-care system.</seg>
<seg id="7">“My first experience was when I was 14 years old and I just wanted to speak to someone who understood where I was coming from,” said Sateana as he recalls a medical appointment in his hometown of Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even as a teen, Sateana felt the nurse and doctor he was seeing made generalizations about his health issues and how they should be treated.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are no Inuit doctors working in Nunavut and a small number of Inuit nurses, meaning many Nunavummiut will never be treated by an Inuk in the health-care system.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sateana decided he wants to change that.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now 23, he is studying in the Health Careers Access Program at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="12">“I really wanted to be seen by an individual who understood my background, my history,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">“To understand the social-economic factors that lead to health issues in the North.”</seg>
<seg id="14">She is from Iqaluit.  As one of only a handful of young Inuit who plans to study medicine in Canada, that decision has pushed Sateana into the spotlight as a role model for other young Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Government of Nunavut’s Department of Health says boosting Inuit representation in the territory’s health-care system is a priority.</seg>
<seg id="16">Currently, roughly half of the department’s employees are Inuit, though only a handful of those work in front-line care.</seg>
<seg id="17">“We believe it is very important to have more Inuit working in the Department of Health,” said Joanne Idlout, the department’s manager of Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="18">“We are constantly trying to promote health careers.”</seg>
<seg id="19">To do that, she’s visiting high school classrooms across Nunavut, handing out health career toolkits that explain to students what kinds of jobs the GN is looking to fill and where students can pursue post-secondary studies.</seg>
<seg id="20">Idlout said the department also offers training and professional development to entry-level staff who may want to build a career in health administration.</seg>
<seg id="21">“It’s really important that Inuit move up, even if they start in administrative positions and can see themselves moving into a more senior management role in a few years,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="22">“We think it’s very important for them to gain that education to allow them to move up in their careers.”</seg>
<seg id="23">But Nunavummiut students who want to move into the health sciences have their work cut out for them.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sateana, who graduated from Maani Ulujuk high school, said Nunavut’s education system did little to prepare him to study medicine.</seg>
<seg id="25">“When I was in high school, there were no biology classes, no chemistry, no physics and no mathematics courses,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">“So my first two years [in university], I was enrolled in classes for 14-16 hours a day … in order for me to qualify and get me where I am.”</seg>
<seg id="27">Even as Sateana has settled into student life, the challenges remain.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sateana is currently working in the health care system in Nunavut, as an outpatient manager assistant at the Kivalliq Health Centre at home in Rankin Inlet while he continues his studies onlne.</seg>
<seg id="29">There, Sateana has found some local patients are hesitant to interact with him in a health care setting.</seg>
<seg id="30">“I was looked at as a person from town and not a professional,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="31">“Just because it is so new for a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="32">So I’ve had to prove my worth, which has been one of the trickier experiences.”</seg>
<seg id="33">Sateana is in high demand elsewhere; the pre-med student is currently being courted by two other Canadian universities and one in the United States, which have all invited him to transfer to their programs in September.</seg>
<seg id="34">Given his motivation to get into medicine in the first place, Sateana said he would like to eventually return to Nunavut to work as a doctor, with a speciality in pediatrics.</seg>
<seg id="35">But as it stands, the GN does not employ a full-time position pediatrics in the Kivalliq region. That’s the branch of medicine that focuses on the care of infants and children.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Department of Health said it currently employs two full-time and one part-time pediatrician in Nunavut, all based in Iqaluit, while the department works to recruit a fourth.</seg>
<seg id="37">Pediatricians are sent to work in most Nunavut communities on a fly-in basis.</seg>
<seg id="38">“Our population within the territory is about 50 per cent under 25 [years of age], so the demography is very much there,” Sateana said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Baffinland production workers unionize, sign collective agreement</seg>
<seg id="2">More than 800 skilled workers at Mary River get wage-benefit deal</seg>
<seg id="3">More than 800 heavy equipment operators, haul truck drivers, skilled tradespeople and other workers at Nunavut’s Mary River iron mine have ratified a collective agreement with Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. (File photo)</seg>
<seg id="4">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 800 heavy equipment operators, haul truck drivers, skilled tradespeople and other workers at Nunavut’s Mary River iron mine are now represented by a union—and they’ve just ratified their first collective agreement with Baffinland Iron Mines Corp.</seg>
<seg id="6">After an organizing drive that Local 793 of the International Union of Operating Engineers started in May 2017, the union was certified by the Canadian Industrial Relations Board in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">And following talks that started in November 2018, IUOE Local 793 members have just said yes to their first wage-benefit deal, which takes effect this May 1.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Seventy-nine-point-three per cent voted in favour, which is overwhelming,” Kathryn Peet, the communications representative for IUOE Local 793, told Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peet also said the negotiations were essentially non-adversarial and led to a type of deal that they describe as a “mutual gains partnership agreement.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“Basically what it means, to have a mutual gains partnership agreement, is when you have two sides that want to negotiate.</seg>
<seg id="11">Baffinland agreed to negotiate with us.</seg>
<seg id="12">We were working with them to come to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="13">We’re trying to figure out ways for both sides to win,” Peet said.</seg>
<seg id="14">“It’s so that the employees are represented in the way that they need to be, but so that the needs of the mine are respected as well,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And the agreement contains provisions that set wage rates, including wage increases that will kick in on May 1, Peet said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ten per cent wage cut left employees behind</seg>
<seg id="17">As for the temporary 10 per cent wage cut that Baffinland imposed on all Mary River employees in September 2015, the new collective agreement would prevent that from happening again, Peet suggested.</seg>
<seg id="18">“All the wage rates and wage increases in the collective agreement are contractually guaranteed over the life of this agreement,” Peet said in an email.</seg>
<seg id="19">Baffinland imposed that 2015 wage cut to help them get through a rough patch. At the time, rock-bottom iron ore prices and missed production targets had hit them hard.</seg>
<seg id="20">In 2017, the company restored that cut by granting a 10 per cent wage increase to its Mary River workers.</seg>
<seg id="21">But those employees were still financially less well-off than they were in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="22">“This, however, was two years after the cut, and in the intervening years they received no wage increase at all.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ultimately, even with the 10 per cent increase, they were behind where they were in 2015,” Peet said.</seg>
<seg id="24">So this situation became an issue in the recent negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="25">“The collective agreement was negotiated with this potential volatility front of mind,” Peet said.</seg>
<seg id="26">A “safety first” culture</seg>
<seg id="27">The new collective agreement also strengthens workplace safety, Peet said.</seg>
<seg id="28">This comes after the death of Tony Anker, 63, a haul truck driver who died on Dec. 16, 2018, in what the company says was a single-vehicle accident.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another worker, Michael Levi, 51, of Arctic Bay, died in an accident that occurred in September 2015.</seg>
<seg id="30">“In the collective agreement both parties confirm their commitment to a genuine ‘safety first’ culture and Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. confirms its responsibility to provide appropriate tools, training, inspections and safety procedures,” Peet said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now, employees have more of a say in workplace safety issues, Peet said.</seg>
<seg id="32">It does this through “additional avenues” for raising safety issues and concerns, she said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also, IUOE Local 793 will sit on a joint health and safety committee alongside Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. representatives and Baffinland employees, she said.</seg>
<seg id="34">“We will all work to ensure that safety remains front of mind for everyone,” Peet said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union runs Morrisburg training centre</seg>
<seg id="36">IUOE Local 793’s sister organization, the Operating Engineers Training Institute of Ontario, is well-known to many Nunavut residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">That’s because of its private technical school for training heavy equipment operators near the village of Morrisburg, Ont., which has been offering training to people from Nunavut since January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="38">“The Operating Engineers Training Institute is the best trainer to be able to train people on how to use the equipment, safety, and respect for their fellow employees,” Peet said.</seg>
<seg id="39">The OETI also runs a program in Oakville, Ont. that trains crane operators.</seg>
<seg id="40">The IUOE Local 793 union represents about 15,000 crane and heavy equipment operators in Ontario and Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="41">Through other locals, the union represents about 400,000 workers across Canada and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="42">“We thank the employees of Baffinland for putting their trust in IUOE local 793 and having the confidence to vote in favour of the tentative agreement,” said Mike Gallagher, the IUOE Local 793 business manager, in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="43">Brian Penney, the president and CEO of Baffinland, said he likes the agreement because it “emphasizes collaboration, fully respects our IIBA [Inuit impact and benefits agreement], and reflects Baffinland’s core value to engage and develop our employees.”</seg>
<seg id="44">And he described the deal as “a unique partnership, based on shared values, which puts employees first.”</seg>

<seg id="2">Inuit groups say the claims process and deadlines pose significant barriers to access</seg>
<seg id="3">Students at Cape Dorset (Kinngait) Federal Hostel, in April 1964.</seg>
<seg id="4">A nationwide class action lawsuit against the Canadian government for survivors of federal Indian day schools has reached a proposed settlement amount, which is expected to be approved by a federal court next month.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Library and Archives Canada)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Sarah Rogers</seg>
<seg id="7">A federal court has rejected an Inuit group’s motion to intervene in a class action lawsuit for survivors of Indian federal day schools.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. was among six groups and plaintiffs that applied to intervene in the McLean Day Schools Class Action, first launched in 2009 for survivors of day schools who were excluded from the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Federal Court Justice Michael Phelan denied NTI’s motion April 25, along with that of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, the Grand Council of the Crees and three individual plaintiffs.</seg>
<seg id="10">In its application, NTI said the scope and timeline of the proposed settlement was “inappropriate” and did not represent the interests of Nunavut Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="11">That’s because the proposed settlement was made public on March 14, though eligible former students only have until May 3 to file objections, the Inuit land claim organization said.</seg>
<seg id="12">“The Inuit of Nunavut have limited access to information and little current awareness of the day school issues, and are unable to meaningfully engage in this deadline,” NTI said in its application.</seg>
<seg id="13">“The claims process and claims deadline contemplated by the proposed settlement do not reflect the reality in Nunavut and impose significant barriers to meaningful access to justice and reconciliation.”</seg>
<seg id="14">The lawsuit could pay students anywhere from $10,000 for harms associated with attending a day school to a maximum of $200,000 for repeated sexual abuse or physical assault that led to long-term injury.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Nunavut, there were 25 eligible federal day schools under the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="16">The number of eligible students is unclear; NTI did not respond to Nunatsiaq News’ request for an interview.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier this year, the land claim organization, alongside Nunavik’s Makivik Corp. and the Inuvialuit Regional Corp., raised concerns that the funds in question are to be paid to and administered by a corporation in which there is no Inuit representation.</seg>
<seg id="18">The law firm Gowling WLG (Canada) LLP is set to receive the $55 million pay-out and will continue to act as the claimants’ class counsel under an additional $7 million in trust payment.</seg>
<seg id="19">In a January letter to Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett, NTI, Makivik and IRC asked the minister to ensure that Inuit organizations have a role in that process.</seg>
<seg id="20">One of those groups confirmed that the minister’s office sent a response to the land claims group just this month, though it’s unclear if Ottawa intends to address their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="21">In Nunavik, there are an estimated 3,000 former students from 11 different schools who could be eligible under the day schools’ agreement.</seg>
<seg id="22">Makivik Corp. says students who attended federal day schools not yet listed in the settlement agreement can request to be included in the agreement by contacting the class counsel at lessard@gowlinggwlg.com or at 1-844-539-3815.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nunavimmiut with questions about their eligibility can also contact Makivik’s legal department at 418-522-2224 ext. 4.</seg>
<seg id="24">The proposed settlement is subject to federal court approval at hearings scheduled May 13-15 in Winnipeg.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lack of local transport leaves Nunavut man in wheelchair stranded</seg>
<seg id="2">“It’s just really hard for a disabled person living in a small community”</seg>
<seg id="3">The Taloyoak family of a man who uses a wheelchair says there are almost no transit options for community members living with reduced mobility or disabilities.</seg>

<seg id="5">By Sarah Rogers</seg>
<seg id="6">Violetta Charlie is supposed to escort her husband to a medical appointment at the end of June, but she’s already worried about how they’ll make it there.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie’s husband, David Jayko, has been disabled since 2015, the combined result of a vehicle accident and damaged knee joints.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 61-year-old does not have use of his legs or arms and uses a wheelchair to get around.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jayko has regular medical appointments in Edmonton, but getting to them has become a headache for his family.</seg>
<seg id="10">That’s because the Taloyoak couple doesn’t own a car, so the otherwise simple task of getting to the airport is a major challenge.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is no taxi service in Taloyoak, nor does the community have an ambulance or adapted transit options available through its health centre.</seg>
<seg id="12">“Just to get a ride to the airport is a real struggle,” Charlie said.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Every time we leave town, this is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">It’s too stressful.”</seg>
<seg id="15">Through a loose agreement with Taloyoak’s home care services, a nurse or assistant has agreed to take Jayko to and from the airport on occasion.</seg>
<seg id="16">But it’s never been guaranteed, Charlie said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The only way to get Jayko to the airport is in a car, Charlie explained, as the seats are less high than in a pickup truck.</seg>
<seg id="18">Transferring the man from his wheelchair to the car takes the help of two or three people, she added.</seg>
<seg id="19">But during Jayko’s last medical trip in early April, when Charlie escorted her husband to Edmonton, she said the couple had to argue with home care workers to get a ride to the airport.</seg>
<seg id="20">When they returned home April 9, they were told a janitor would pick them up, though no one from the centre was there to meet them when they arrived.</seg>
<seg id="21">“At this point, we don’t want to go anymore, it’s too much bother,” Charlie said.</seg>
<seg id="22">“I have to fight and make phone calls just to get a 10-minute ride.</seg>
<seg id="23">No one seems to know whose responsibility it is.”</seg>
<seg id="24">Charlie has complained to the health centre and local hamlet office, whose senior administrative officer sent a series of emails to the Department of Health in April.</seg>
<seg id="25">“This is another case of the Taloyoak Health Centre not even trying to meet the needs of this community,” SAO Grant Scott wrote to a number of health officials in an April 1 email.</seg>
<seg id="26">“The health centre knows what Mr. Jayko is capable and not capable to do, given his medical condition, yet they turn their backs on him.”</seg>
<seg id="27">In an emailed response, a director of health programs for the Kitikmeot region acknowledged the lack of transport for people living with mobility issues in many Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="28">But the Department of Health does not provide any non-emergency medical ground transportation in communities, the health official explained, because it is not an insured service.</seg>
<seg id="29">In Taloyoak, home care nurses and other health care staff are not insured to drive community members.</seg>
<seg id="30">Clients are responsible for arranging transportation to the health centre or airport for approved medical travel, the Department of Health said in an email to Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="31">Non-emergency transportation to the airport for approved medical travel is covered by Non-Insured Health Benefits for eligible Nunavut Inuit in only four communities: Coral Harbour, Whale Cove, Arctic Bay and Resolute Bay, where the distance to the airport is considered exceptional (more than six kilometres.)</seg>
<seg id="32">And in some cases, the NIHB or the GN’s Extended Health Benefits program could cover emergency inter-facility transfers from the health centre to the medevac plane, though that has not been the case for the Jayko family.</seg>
<seg id="33">Noah Papatsie with the Nunavummi Disabilities Makinnasuaqtiit Society said transportation for Nunavummiut with disability issues is sorely lacking across the territory, and it’s a gap he believes should be filled by the GN.</seg>
<seg id="34">Iqaluit, his home community, is large enough that its health services offers transport to elders and other residents living with reduced mobility.</seg>
<seg id="35">“But in other communities it’s hard—they are all having the same problem,” Papatsie said.</seg>
<seg id="36">“We need to communicate those needs.</seg>
<seg id="37">There should be a better system and we should have better access.”</seg>
<seg id="38">Charlie said since she has complained to the Department of Health, officials have at least tried to find solutions for the family.</seg>
<seg id="39">She was told the department could ask her to sign a waiver that would absolve the GN’s responsibility should anything happen during transport to the airport.</seg>
<seg id="40">“I’m willing to do that because we have absolutely no other option,” Charlie said.</seg>
<seg id="41">“We’re having discussions now; we’re talking about it, but we should have had this conversation a long time ago,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">“It’s just really hard for a disabled person living in a small community.”</seg>

<seg id="1">FASD in Nunavut a health-care rights issue, stakeholders say</seg>
<seg id="2">“It’s the right of that child, it’s the right of that adult to get some answers”</seg>
<seg id="3">This graphic was produced in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control in 2015 to promote awareness of the human and financial costs of FASD.</seg>
<seg id="4">The total economic cost to Canada is at least $1.8 billion a year, and the total cost per person with FASD is around $1.12 million over the course of their life.</seg>
<seg id="5">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="6">People in Nunavut with FASD, along with their families, have the right to know they have the disability, Nunavut-based advocates say.</seg>
<seg id="7">But due to a lack of screening and diagnosis, that right is likely not being met within Nunavut’s health and education departments.</seg>
<seg id="8">“It’s about systems not actually realizing that they are violating the rights of children and even adults and their families,” said Jennifer Noah, the executive director of the Piruqatigiit Resource Centre in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="9">Piruqatigiit is a new non-profit organization in Iqaluit set up to help people and families living with FASD.</seg>
<seg id="10">Experts say that FASD, short for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, a permanent disability, is more widespread in Canada than autism or Down syndrome, two other disorders that receive far more funding and public attention.</seg>
<seg id="11">In Canada, the annual cost to the economy associated with FASD is about $1.8 billion and the lifetime cost per person with FASD is $1.12 million, Dr. Svetlana Popova of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health reported in a study published in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">The term “FASD” covers a wide range of lifelong cognitive and physical deficits caused when a fetus is exposed to alcohol inside a mother’s womb.</seg>
<seg id="13">Though the disability is believed to be widespread in Nunavut, the 2007-08 Inuit health survey, conducted in Nunavut, Nunatsiavut and the Inuvialuit region, reported no information on alcohol consumption by pregnant mothers and no other data on the prevalence of FASD.</seg>
<seg id="14">And Nunavut’s minister of education, David Joanasie, said last March that while he knows of numerous children in school with undiagnosed FASD, the department is not able to track them.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2011, another survey based on a smaller sample of Nunavik women, found 61 per cent reported drinking during pregnancy, and that 38 per cent of pregnant women reported binge drinking.</seg>
<seg id="16">And Svetlana Popova, a scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, told Nunatsiaq News last week that vulnerable populations, such as Indigenous people, suffer from FASD at rates 10 to 40 times higher than the general population.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since no amount of alcohol, cannabis or tobacco is considered safe to consume during pregnancy, this suggests there are many people in Nunavut whose FASD is hidden or unknown to them or others.</seg>
<seg id="18">Noah, based on her experience with addictions and counselling, agrees with that kind of assessment.</seg>
<seg id="19">“I will say that FASD is far more prevalent than we can imagine, not only in Iqaluit and Nunavut, but in all places.</seg>
<seg id="20">FASD is four times more common than autism and Down’s syndrome combined,” Noah said.</seg>
<seg id="21">“We are not at all suggesting that it is only an Inuit problem. It’s absolutely everywhere that there is alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is time that we do some level of service provision,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is not safe to consume any amount of alcohol during pregnancy, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the 2004 Qanuippitaa survey in Nunavik, a region with a culture and history that is similar to Nunavut’s, reported that 44.2 per cent of women surveyed in Nunavik reported drinking alcohol during their last pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="25">(Image courtesy of the GN)</seg>
<seg id="26">Barrier to employment</seg>
<seg id="27">FASD, if not screened for or diagnosed, can become a permanent barrier to getting a job or even training that could lead to a job.</seg>
<seg id="28">That’s because FASD often damages memory, the ability to learn how to use language to communicate, and social skills required for labour force participation.</seg>
<seg id="29">For that reason, Piruqatigiit wants to offer a certificate program to train service providers for people with FASD, Noah said.</seg>
<seg id="30">“We’re trying to train front-line service providers so they can be FASD- and trauma-informed, so they can do a better job of being aware of the unique needs and challenges and strengths of people with FASD,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Helen Roos, the executive director of the Ilinniapaa Skills Development Centre in Iqaluit, also agrees that people with unscreened and undiagnosed FASD have basic health-care rights that Nunavut may be ignoring.</seg>
<seg id="32">Right to know about one’s own health</seg>
<seg id="33">“It’s the right of that child, it’s the right of that adult to get some answers,” Roos said.</seg>
<seg id="34">“People have the right to answers to questions about their own health.</seg>
<seg id="35">And if there are questions about their development or growth, they have the right to screening [for FASD],” she said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Roos said this means that unacknowledged FASD is a big barrier to labour market participation.</seg>
<seg id="37">“In my seven years, especially my six years in working in pre-employment training with Inuit, we see it [FASD] in spades,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="38">“It becomes a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="39">They are not screened in elementary school or high school.”</seg>
<seg id="40">That’s because people with FASD often struggle with language and memory problems that make it difficult for them to understand instructions that are given to them in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="41">And that, in turn, means that such people will find it extremely difficult to train for jobs in Nunavut’s two biggest industries: mining and government.</seg>
<seg id="42">“In mining, where everything is health and safety and wellness, and safety is number one, if you can’t remember safety precautions for yourself, you’re not going to be able to work in that environment.</seg>
<seg id="43">In government you need high rates of literacy.” she said.</seg>
<seg id="44">But that doesn’t mean that people with FASD are doomed to a life of unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="45">“There are employment opportunities, but they require job coaches,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="46">For Iqaluit-Manirajak MLA Adam Arreak Lightstone, it’s crucial that the Department of Education identify children with FASD and offer them help, as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="47">“Early intervention is crucial for those living with FASD, as we must assist them to learn to live with their disability before it is too late,” Lightstone told Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="48">“I believe that the Department of Education must consider this a priority by offering training to our school faculty to identify students who show symptoms of FASD,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="49">But right now, very few Nunavummiut with FASD appear to be screened or diagnosed in Nunavut, Roos said, except for a few who were fortunate enough to have moved to the south.</seg>
<seg id="50">“They never got any assistance with screening or diagnosis unless they grew up in or moved to the south, in Montreal or Ottawa, or were picked up, in the Kitikmeot and got screening through Stanton hospital in Yellowknife,” Roos said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jailhouse blues: Nunavut’s incarceration rate rose last year</seg>
<seg id="2">Proportion of Nunavut residents jailed or imprisoned rose 7 per cent in 2017-18</seg>
<seg id="3">A view of the correctional healing facility in Rankin Inlet, as it looked in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite a drop in national incarceration rates over the past five years, the proportion of Nunavut residents jailed or imprisoned in 2017-18 rose by seven per cent over the previous year, says Statistics Canada.</seg>
<seg id="6">The incarceration rate in the Northwest Territories was almost as high, at 527 per 100,000, but more than 50 per cent lower in Yukon, at 191 per 100,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">“The incarceration rate in all three territories was well above the provincial and territorial average,” the report said.</seg>
<seg id="8">In all three territories, incarceration rates exceeded the national and provincial average.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the N.W.T and Yukon incarceration rates, although still high, are declining.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Nunavut, however, incarceration rates rose by seven per cent.</seg>
<seg id="11">That’s the opposite of the national trend.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report’s numbers show that, nationally, fewer Canadians are going to provincial-territorial jails or federal prisons.</seg>
<seg id="13">“While the national incarceration rate has fluctuated over 25 years, it has declined every year over the last five years,” the report said.</seg>
<seg id="14">“In 2017/2018, the national incarceration rate was 131 adults per 100,000 population, a four per cent decrease from 2016-17,” the report said.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Incarceration rate” means the average number of adults in either sentenced custody, remand or other forms of temporary detention, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report does not give the cost to Nunavut of keeping prisoners in jail.</seg>
<seg id="17">That’s because the relevant financial information for Nunavut is not available, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="18">But in the N.W.T., the cost is $435 per day per prisoner and in Yukon, $507 per day per prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="19">For inmates doing time in federal prisons, the cost is $330 per day per prisoner, and the average for all provinces and territorial institutions is $233 per day per prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="20">Remand prisoners outnumber those serving sentences</seg>
<seg id="21">Another feature of Nunavut’s incarcerated population is that in Nunavut, as in eight other jurisdictions, remand prisoners outnumber sentenced prisoners, the report found.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Nunavut, more than half of all incarcerated people—55 per cent—were remand prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="23">“Remand” prisoners are those charged with crimes but who are ordered to stay in custody until after the courts process their cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">The practice is controversial, because remand prisoners often don’t get access to programs available to sentenced prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="25">“A greater number of adults in remand than in sentenced custody in provincial-territorial correctional facilities can lead to various challenges associated with providing services to inmates, such as rehabilitation and housing, due to the uncertainty regarding their length of stay,” the report said.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the trend toward the increased incarceration of people awaiting trial likely reflects a “cultural shift” in the justice system.</seg>
<seg id="27">“The view here is that in order to minimize the risk of danger to the general public, including the risk of re-offending, courts choose to remand more accused as they wait for their trial/sentence,” the report said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nearly 2,000 admissions</seg>
<seg id="29">Another number that the study reported is the number of “admissions,” which means any movement into jail, prison or some form of community supervision, such as probation.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Nunavut, the admission numbers for 2017-18 were:</seg>
<seg id="31">• Sentenced prisoners admitted to incarceration: 415</seg>
<seg id="32">• Remand prisoners admitted to incarceration: 567</seg>
<seg id="33">• Convicted offenders admitted to some form of community supervision: 900</seg>
<seg id="34">• Total number admitted into the correction services: 1,882</seg>
<seg id="35">One disturbing national statistic is the grossly disproportionate number of Indigenous adults in custody in 2017-18: 30 per cent of all provincial and territorial inmates and 29 per cent of all federal inmates.</seg>
<seg id="36">Indigenous people comprise only 4.9 per cent of Canada’s population, according to the 2016 census.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sudden sale of Rankin Inlet pharmacy still rankles Kivalliq residents</seg>
<seg id="2">“I liked the idea of supporting an Inuit-owned company. … I would like to know why they sold out to Northern”</seg>
<seg id="3">Cathy Towtongie, MLA for Rankin Inlet North, says she wants to know more about the reasoning behind Sakku Investments Corp.’s sale of Sakku Pharmacy to the North West Co. (File photo)</seg>
<seg id="4">By Thomas Rohner Special to Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">The sale of Inuit-owned Sakku Pharmacy in Rankin Inlet in February to the North West Co. happened so quickly and amid such secrecy that many residents are still asking questions.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Sakku Investments Corp., the economic development arm of the Kivalliq Inuit Association that had majority ownership of the company, remains tight-lipped about the sale.</seg>
<seg id="7">“As an Inuk beneficiary, we haven’t seen financial statements or the reasoning behind the sale. There’s something going on here that we don’t know about,” said Cathy Towtongie, MLA for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="8">“It was all done in top confidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when [Sakku Pharmacy] was closing and started to move over to the Northern did we find out.”</seg>
<seg id="10">That occurred in late January, residents say.</seg>
<seg id="11">By February, the new pharmacy opened across the street inside Rankin Inlet’s Northern Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">“I liked the idea of supporting an Inuit-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="13">I liked Sakku Drugs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Why did they sell out?</seg>
<seg id="15">I wish it didn’t happen.</seg>
<seg id="16">I would like to know why they sold out to Northern,” one resident said.</seg>
<seg id="17">“I hope people shake their heads and realize, Sakku sold it to Northern because it was an easy way to make a quick buck,” said another resident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sakku Investments did not respond to multiple requests over email and phone for information or comment.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to their website, the Inuit company’s mission is “to invest in viable business enterprises to the betterment of the Inuit of the Kivalliq Region.”</seg>
<seg id="20">Sakku Pharmacy, which had its day-to-day operations managed by the Super Thrifty Pharmacy in Manitoba, is widely believed to have been a profitable business serving the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nunatsiaq News received information that suggests the pharmacy regularly pulled in over $200,000 in sales each month.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sakku Investments’ website says its guiding principles include transparency and decision by consensus.</seg>
<seg id="23">The corporation does not make its financial statements publicly available.</seg>
<seg id="24">Their website also lists Inuit empowerment and employment through training, mentoring and learning as guiding principles.</seg>
<seg id="25">But while the pharmacy regularly saw high turnover among most of its staff, its one long-time Inuk staff member told Nunatsiaq News that Sakku Investments never offered her an opportunity for greater training, education or advancement.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nunatsiaq News has agreed to not publish the name of the former employee at her request.</seg>
<seg id="27">And after more than 20 years of service, the former employee, a cashier who regularly provided interpretation service for elders, said she also did not receive any severance pay from Sakku Investments or Super Thrifty.</seg>
<seg id="28">“We’re not giving any comments and don’t wish to participate in your story,” a spokesperson from Super Thrifty’s head office said.</seg>
<seg id="29">The former Inuk employee said she was offered a new job by the Northern Store as a cashier, but she was not comfortable taking that job.</seg>
<seg id="30">“At Sakku I also helped the pharmacist and technicians with the elders when they needed my help interpreting … I can do more than just being a cashier,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Towtongie agreed: “I wish she had been rehired with the Northern because she knows the customers, the clientele, she’s very reliable and service is needed in both Inuktitut and English.”</seg>
<seg id="32">The North West Co. addressed some local concerns on Facebook about English-Inuktut interpretation.</seg>
<seg id="33">Staff at the Northern who have signed pledges of confidentiality can provide translation when requested, Tim Smith, director of pharmacy operations for the company, said on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="34">“Should we look to hire additional pharmacy staff in the future, we would consider Inuktut fluency a significant asset.”</seg>
<seg id="35">But some residents found that response not good enough.</seg>
<seg id="36">“To use an ordinary person for an interpreter for a project like yours sounds like you’re unaware of the professionalism of your capacity,” one resident replied.</seg>
<seg id="37">“Please do not rely on cashiers and stock boys to help you,” posted another resident who identified himself as a longtime interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="38">When asked why the former employee of Sakku with more than 20 years of experience was not hired to interpret for elders, NWC spokesperson Derek Reimer said store employees are providing translation services similar to what Sakku provided.</seg>
<seg id="39">“I don’t see a difference,” Reimer said.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other concerns raised by Rankin Inlet residents to Nunatsiaq News included privacy concerns: the new pharmacy is in a small space and one resident said she easily overheard another person’s prescription.</seg>
<seg id="41">Another resident questioned whether patient consent is needed to transfer sensitive health information from Sakku Pharmacy to a private company.</seg>
<seg id="42">“As per privacy regulations, our pharmacy and staff members are regulated by the Personal Health Information Act which protects the privacy and personal information of patients,” Reimer said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="43">The NWC also acquired the Kitnuna Pharmacy in Cambridge Bay in late 2018.</seg>
<seg id="44">That pharmacy, also a profitable business, was a joint venture between the Kitikmeot Inuit Association’s business development arm and Super Thrifty.</seg>
<seg id="45">“This was a business decision based on the outlook of this particular business,” wrote Tim Zehr in an email.</seg>
<seg id="46">Zehr is the president of the Kitnuna Group of Companies, a subsidiary of KitIA.</seg>
<seg id="47">Residents in both Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay complained their new pharmacies offer a smaller selection of crucial items such as baby formula and feminine hygiene products at a higher cost.</seg>
<seg id="48">“We work with certain suppliers and try to retain a good assortment of products for our customers,” Reimer said.</seg>
<seg id="49">“We can’t always replicate the assortment they previously had.”</seg>
<seg id="50">Reimer said the two acquisitions are part of the company’s mission to increase health access in under-served communities.</seg>
<seg id="51">“North West brings considerable experience and expertise providing pharmacy services to over 80 Inuit, First Nations and Metis communities across northern Canada.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut youth speak out about access to mental health services in new report</seg>
<seg id="2">“If this type of investment and shift does not occur, then we can no longer continue to be shocked by staggering youth suicide statistics”</seg>
<seg id="3">Nunavut’s Representative for Children and Youth’s Office released its first systemic review Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The report highlights the voices of children and youth across the territory about access to and availability of mental health services.</seg>
<seg id="5">By Emma Tranter</seg>
<seg id="6">Young Nunavummiut are speaking out about access to mental health services across the territory in a new report from Nunavut’s representative for children and youth.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Wednesday, the Representative for Children and Youth’s Office released a 54-page review titled, “Our Minds Matter: A Youth-Informed Review of Mental Health Services for Young Nunavummiut.”</seg>
<seg id="8">The report, which is the first systemic review conducted by the RCYO, also spells out 15 recommendations to the Government of Nunavut to develop a mental health strategy for children and youth in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="9">“Each of the recommendations in the report is aimed at improving the unacceptable state of mental health services for children and youth in Nunavut,” said Sherry McNeil-Mulak, Nunavut’s representative for children and youth, at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="10">The RCYO is an independent officer of the Nunavut legislature who works to ensure the GN supports and protects the rights of young Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="11">The office is guided by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Inuit societal values and national advocacy standards, the report states.</seg>
<seg id="12">The office surveyed 475 individuals across the territory, including 225 youth.</seg>
<seg id="13">The survey was administered in person in 11 of Nunavut’s 25 communities and was anonymous, McNeil-Mulak said.</seg>
<seg id="14">McNeil-Mulak said throughout the review, the office repeatedly heard the need to have mental health services available in schools.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although many schools have Ilinniarvimmi Inuusilirijiit, or school counsellors, it is not their role to provide clinical mental health services, the report states.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report groups its 15 recommendations into five categories: mental health in schools, residential mental health services and the continuum of care, mental health workforce, awareness and barriers, and recreational, cultural and leisure activities.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recommendations include universal mental health programming in schools, college programs to build the capacity of Nunavut’s mental health workforce and cultural competency training for mental health service providers.</seg>
<seg id="18">Another recommendation calls for an in-territory facility that offers residential mental health treatment for children and youth, which currently does not exist in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="19">“If this type of investment and shift does not occur, then we can no longer continue to be shocked by staggering youth suicide statistics and outraged when hurt and helplessness disguise themselves as undesirable behaviour affecting our communities,” McNeil-Mulak said.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition to a transient mental health workforce, the report notes that another barrier Nunavut youth face in accessing mental health services is the stigma toward people with a mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="21">One youth participant in the survey wrote he or she would feel comfortable asking for help, “if I knew the services were available and I knew getting services wouldn’t make my family life worse.”</seg>
<seg id="22">The report states that 60 per cent of all health-related cases opened by the RCYO are related to difficulties faced by youth in Nunavut when it comes to mental health services.</seg>
<seg id="23">In February 2018, the Department of Health announced that one to two mental health and addictions outreach workers, or MHAs, would be allocated to each community.</seg>
<seg id="24">The MHA jobs were intended to be filled by local, preferably Inuktitut speaking Inuit who would receive on-the-job training, the report states.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite requesting the training document for these roles from the department, the report states the document remains in draft form and training is not being delivered for these roles.</seg>
<seg id="26">In another section of the review 82 per cent of the GN’s service providers say they don’t feel the availability of mental health services for young people in the territory is meeting their needs.</seg>
<seg id="27">On top of that, 72 per cent don’t think the quality of those services is adequate.</seg>
<seg id="28">In a survey of the general population, the report reveals that 91 per cent of participants feel the availability of mental health services for young people in the territory is not meeting their needs.</seg>
<seg id="29">McNeil-Mulak said her office is aware some of the report’s recommendations have been put forward before.</seg>
<seg id="30">“Until children and youth in Nunavut are able to access the mental health services that they need, they have a right to, in their own territory, we will continue to urge the government of Nunavut to implement these recommendations,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Legally, the government has 40 days to respond to the report, making the deadline September 30.</seg>
<seg id="32">“Each of these recommendations will be closely monitored, and progress will be reported by our office in an ongoing basis,” McNeil-Mulak said.</seg>

<seg id="1">We can’t determine FASD prevalence, Nunavut government says</seg>
<seg id="2">But small FASD diagnostic team starts work at Qikiqtani hospital</seg>
<seg id="3">This is a graphic produced by the FASD Hub Australia, which distributes information about the disorder online.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="5">The Government of Nunavut still can’t generate numbers on the prevalence of FASD within the territory’s population, a spokesperson for the GN’s Department of Health told Nunatsiaq News this week.</seg>
<seg id="6">“At this time, ascertainment of the existence of FASD is based on case-reviews, and is not possible at the population level using traditional surveillance techniques,” the GN said.</seg>
<seg id="7">That’s because the territorial epidemiological surveillance work that the GN does is “designed to provide data for national surveillance programs, which do not include surveillance for FASD,” said the email, prepared by Wende Halonen, a senior communications officer at the GN, in response to questions from Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="8">Also, the GN says such work is difficult and expensive.</seg>
<seg id="9">“Epidemiological surveillance for FASD is an emerging area of work, requires significant resources from clinical and non-clinical perspectives, and is premised on internationally agreed upon case definitions,” the Health Department said.</seg>
<seg id="10">But at the same time, the GN says it now has the capacity to diagnose FASD, through a three-person team that recently started up at the Qikiqtani General Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="11">The term “FASD,” short for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, covers a range of permanent, lifelong mental and physical disabilities experienced by those who receive exposure to alcohol in the womb.</seg>
<seg id="12">It’s the most common known cause of developmental disability in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the CanFASD research network, about four per cent of the country’s population, around 1.4 million people, likely have FASD, at a cost to governments of at least $4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="14">Experts say those who suffer from FASD can do well in life if they are diagnosed early and get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="15">But its prevalence in Nunavut—as in many other remote and rural regions of Canada—has never been measured.</seg>
<seg id="16">And that makes it difficult for health and education leaders to justify the spending of government money to help people with FASD, whether they’re school kids or developmentally disabled adults struggling to get jobs and training.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Indeed, we don’t know anything about the current prevalence of FASD among northern communities or remote communities,” Dr. Svetlana Popova of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health told Nunatsiaq News in an interview earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A study released last month by a team Popova led found the prevalence of FASD is higher in certain vulnerable groups, such as correctional inmates, children in foster care and some Indigenous populations.  Be wary of stigmatizing stereotypes</seg>
<seg id="19">Some researchers worry that the absence of research could result in Indigenous peoples being stereotyped.</seg>
<seg id="20">“Prevalence studies with Indigenous communities in particular have produced conflicting results because of continued surveillance, stigmatization, and stereotyping in these populations,” says an article that the CanFASD network published in July 2018.</seg>
<seg id="21">“There is an urgent need for additional exploration of these issues in order to properly identify vulnerable groups who may require specialized support,” the article said.</seg>
<seg id="22">But without early intervention and help, those who do have FASD often struggle behaviour problems in school, and either wind up inside the correctional system or find themselves permanently barred from participation in the labour market.</seg>
<seg id="23">The GN does gather information from expectant mothers on substance abuse during their pregnancies, but the GN does not use it to help them figure out the prevalence of FASD.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Maternal and prenatal care is of high priority to the department,” the Health Department email said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Last March, Education Minister David Joanasie admitted that, although he knows there are likely many cases of undiagnosed FASD among Nunavut students, his department can’t track them right now.</seg>
<seg id="26">Adam Lightstone, the MLA for Iqaluit-Manirajak, told Nunatsiaq News that he was “a bit taken aback” by that response and that the department must do more to find out who needs help for FASD.</seg>
<seg id="27">“Early intervention is crucial for those living with FASD, as we must assist them to learn to live with their disability before it is too late,” Lightstone said earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="28">But despite its well-publicized capacity problems, the GN is not entirely ignoring FASD.</seg>
<seg id="29">Pediatric unit at QGH now does FASD diagnoses</seg>
<seg id="30">For example, the three-person team at the Qikiqtani General Hospital in Iqaluit is now past the pilot project stage and is now set up to do FASD diagnosis, the Health Department said in its email.</seg>
<seg id="31">That team consists of a neuropsychologist, a pediatrician and a speech-language pathologist.</seg>
<seg id="32">“Children at risk for having FASD receive an initial assessment by a team of trained health care professionals,” the department told Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="33">“The team then collaborates in a multidisciplinary fashion (with guardian consent) to determine the diagnosis and care plans for children with prenatal alcohol exposure.”</seg>
<seg id="34">Right now, that small team works only within the Baffin region, the GN said.</seg>
<seg id="35">That appears to partly address a big criticism that Justice Robert Kilpatrick, the former senior judge of the Nunavut court, made in a judgment he issued in 2013, when he lambasted the GN’s Health Department for being unable to diagnose FASD.</seg>
<seg id="36">That was in relation to a case involving the sentencing of a Nunavut offender who could not get an FASD diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kilpatrick warned that the Nunavut court might force the GN to pay for such diagnostic services in the future.</seg>
<seg id="38">“If the territory lacks the means to provide the diagnostic services required, the court has the ability to order out-of-territory forensic assessments to be performed where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="39">The court will not hesitate to do so where this is required for sentencing purposes,” Kilpatrick said.</seg>
<seg id="40">Audrey McFarlane, the executive director of CanFASD, a nationwide research network, said Nunavut has actually been involved in the issue for years, through an entity called the Canada-Northwest FASD Partnership, a knowledge-sharing group comprising the three territories and the four western provinces.</seg>
<seg id="41">“They have been the leaders in Canada in developing evidence-based support services long before anyone else in central or eastern Canada,” McFarlane said.</seg>
<seg id="42">This is a poster that the Government of Nunavut has produced recently to raise awareness about FASD.  GN focuses on prevention</seg>
<seg id="43">One FASD activity the Health Department does emphasize is its prevention work.</seg>
<seg id="44">“The GN strives to share messages that acknowledge and value the people with FASD who live in our communities, while at the same time reducing the number of substance-exposed pregnancies,” the Health Department said.</seg>
<seg id="45">To that end, the GN told Nunatsiaq News it has recently produced the following:</seg>
<seg id="46">• An updated poster to raise awareness about FASD</seg>
<seg id="47">• A handout about substance-free pregnancy for young adults, pregnant women and their support people</seg>
<seg id="48">• Handouts for healthcare providers to support them in having discussions with their clients</seg>
<seg id="49">And the GN also said other FASD activities include the following:</seg>
<seg id="50">• Community health workers provide key messages about reducing the risk of FASD and have community events during FASD Awareness Month every September.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Lesson plans to accompany videos about reducing the harms of alcohol have been produced by the Ilisaqsivik Society.</seg>
<seg id="52">Two of them discuss alcohol use and pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="53">• Nunavut health officials participate in the FASD Mentoring Project, a project coordinated by the Saskatchewan Prevention Institute and funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada, which provides training to community workers about FASD.</seg>
<seg id="54">• All healthcare providers are supposed to screen for alcohol use during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="55">• Mental health and addictions care are available to anyone who wants support.</seg>
<seg id="56">That covers much of what McFarlane said governments should do more of, which includes:</seg>
<seg id="57">• Developing more public awareness.</seg>
<seg id="58">• Encouraging doctors, nurses and counsellors to give consistent messages on FASD when advising expectant mothers.</seg>
<seg id="59">• Identifying women who need help with support and addictions treatment, including women who have FASD themselves.</seg>
<seg id="60">Also, McFarlane’s organization provides online training courses available to everyone, including a free course called “Foundations in FASD”</seg>
<seg id="61">The FASD Hub Australia also provides e-learning and online resources.</seg>

<seg id="1">Violence against Indigenous women amounts to genocide: MMIWG inquiry</seg>
<seg id="2">“We live in a country whose laws and institutions perpetuate violations of fundamental rights”</seg>
<seg id="3">“Despite their different circumstances and backgrounds, all of the missing and murdered are connected by economic, social and political marginalization, racism, and misogyny woven into the fabric of Canadian society,” said the inquiry’s Chief Commissioner Marion Buller at the commission’s closing ceremony in Gatineau, Que., on Monday, June 3.</seg>

<seg id="5">By Sarah Rogers</seg>
<seg id="6">The staggering rates of violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada amount to a form of race-based genocide, a national commission has concluded, following a two-year inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="7">In its final report, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls said that deliberate, ongoing human and Indigenous rights violations are the root cause behind that violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Despite their different circumstances and backgrounds, all of the missing and murdered are connected by economic, social and political marginalization, racism, and misogyny woven into the fabric of Canadian society,” said the inquiry’s chief commissioner, Marion Buller, at the commission’s closing ceremony in Gatineau, Que., on Monday, June 3.</seg>
<seg id="9">“The hard truth is that we live in a country whose laws and institutions perpetuate violations of fundamental rights, amounting to a genocide against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA (two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual) people.”</seg>
<seg id="10">The report looks back to the very first harmful encounters Indigenous women faced, from 16th century explorers and early Christian missionaries, who staked claims to Indigenous territory and challenged Indigenous leadership and ways of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those colonial structures persist today, the report noted, through tools like the Indian Act, the residential school legacy and child welfare systems.</seg>
<seg id="12">The inquiry’s report acknowledges that there is disagreement around what constitutes genocide and whether or not it applies to Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Genocide is the sum of the social practices, assumptions, and actions detailed within this report; as many witnesses expressed, this country is at war, and Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people are under siege,” the report said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Commissioners said it was impossible to determine the exact number of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada, though it’s estimated in the thousands.</seg>
<seg id="15">In attendance at the final ceremony, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau welcomed the report and pledged his government’s support in responding to its recommendations with “meaningful, Indigenous-led action.”</seg>
<seg id="16">But many noted that the prime minister did not use or acknowledge the term genocide.</seg>
<seg id="17">Asked about that later, Chief Commissioner Buller responded: “We don’t need to hear the word genocide come out of the prime minister’s mouth, because families have told us their truth.”</seg>
<seg id="18">The report is the culmination of a process that lasted two and a half years and included community hearings, expert panels, and the testimony and input of over 2,300 people, including hundreds of Inuit who gave testimony or statements.</seg>
<seg id="19">The report delivers 231 recommendations, called calls for justice, directed at governments, social services, industry and Canadians in general.</seg>
<seg id="20">Those calls for justice include the following:</seg>
<seg id="21">• stricter penalties for men who are found guilty of spousal abuse and domestic violence</seg>
<seg id="22">• a review of Gladue principles in court and more Indigenous-specific sentencing options</seg>
<seg id="23">• more Indigenous representation in the criminal justice system  • the establishment of a national Indigenous and human rights ombudsperson and human rights tribunal</seg>
<seg id="24">• long-term funding for education programs and awareness campaigns that target violence prevention</seg>
<seg id="25">• an end to the apprehension of Indigenous children on the basis of poverty and cultural bias</seg>
<seg id="26">The report also includes 46 Inuit-specific recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="27">Among them, a call for governments to honour land claims and their socio-economic commitments to Inuit, the creation of laws and services to protect Inuit culture, and the recognition of Inuktut as an official language in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chief Commissioner Buller said on Monday morning that the calls for justice “are not just recommendations, they are legal imperatives.”</seg>
<seg id="29">You can read the full report in English, as well as an executive summary of the report in Inuktitut at the inquiry’s website.</seg>
<seg id="30">Read more about the Inuit-specific recommendations and reaction to the report later at Nunatsiaq.com.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut’s Education Department suffers from a people problem</seg>
<seg id="2">“The Department of Education’s biggest problem right now has nothing to do with legislation”</seg>
<seg id="3">Opening day at Aqsarniit Middle School in Iqaluit more than 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">This week the Nunavut government will table its latest attempt to amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="5">(File photo)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">The Government of Nunavut will likely introduce Bill 25 in the legislative assembly this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bill will most probably resemble the GN’s last attempt to change the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="9">That one fizzled in the spring of 2017, when, after large expenditures of time, energy and money, regular MLAs simply refused to debate the GN’s proposals.</seg>
<seg id="10">Will the second attempt succeed?</seg>
<seg id="11">Maybe, maybe not.</seg>
<seg id="12">But you know what?</seg>
<seg id="13">Set against the biggest issue the GN faces in education, it may not even matter.</seg>
<seg id="14">That’s because the Department of Education’s biggest problem right now has nothing to do with legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its biggest problem is a human resource issue and a training issue.</seg>
<seg id="16">To some extent, it’s also a budget issue.</seg>
<seg id="17">That is the long-standing shortage of Inuit-language teachers in Nunavut, coupled with continuing uncertainty about the health of the Nunavut Arctic College program that is supposed to train such teachers: the Nunavut Teacher Education Program.</seg>
<seg id="18">In simple terms, it’s a people problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">And until that people problem is addressed, it won’t matter what either the Education Act or the Inuit Language Protection Act end up saying about education in the Inuit language.</seg>
<seg id="20">The current version of the Education Act, which came into effect in 2008, contained a schedule for introducing bilingual English-Inuktut instruction by 2019, from kindergarten to Grade 12, in all Nunavut schools.</seg>
<seg id="21">Those language of instruction measures were dead on arrival.</seg>
<seg id="22">For those who hadn’t already figured this out for themselves, the Auditor General of Canada’s 2013 report providing damning confirmation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The main reason for this failure, of course, is that the Department of Education is not even close to being able to employ sufficient numbers of Inuit-language teachers.</seg>
<seg id="24">The leads to a self-perpetuating downward spiral.</seg>
<seg id="25">“The lack of bilingual teachers will affect the department’s capacity to produce bilingual graduates who could continue their education and qualify as bilingual teachers,” the auditor general said.</seg>
<seg id="26">One reason for that, of course, is that the Nunavut Teacher Education Program does not produce enough fully bilingual graduates to meet the Department of Education’s needs.</seg>
<seg id="27">The incapacities of NTEP are no secret.</seg>
<seg id="28">As far back as 2012, some MLAs and mayors were complaining that some of its graduates were not qualified for teaching jobs, while some who were able to get jobs were quitting or getting dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Where’s the NTEP review?</seg>
<seg id="30">A few years later, in early 2017, Paul Quassa, then the minister of education, said some graduates of NTEP prefer to teach in English.</seg>
<seg id="31">For that, and other reasons, he promised the GN would do a “review” of NTEP.</seg>
<seg id="32">So what did that review say?</seg>
<seg id="33">We don’t know.</seg>
<seg id="34">In March of 2017, the GN hired a firm to do that review of NTEP.</seg>
<seg id="35">Quassa, still serving as minister, promised the work would be done by June of that year.</seg>
<seg id="36">But if the NTEP review report has indeed been completed, the GN has not made it public.</seg>
<seg id="37">We’re still waiting for it.</seg>
<seg id="38">Significantly, few, if any MLAs have bothered to ask about it.</seg>
<seg id="39">Meanwhile, the current minister of education, David Joanasie, bragged last November that a record number of people are enrolled this year in the NTEP program: 93 people, 90 of whom are Nunavut Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="40">They’re scattered around nine communities and studying at various levels, with 23 expected to graduate this year.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the surface that looks like a mildly encouraging development.</seg>
<seg id="42">But no one knows how many of those participants will make it to the end.</seg>
<seg id="43">And of those who graduate, no one knows how many will stay in the teaching profession.</seg>
<seg id="44">The employment rolls of multiple Inuit organizations and government departments are filled with the names of former Inuit teachers who were educated at the government’s expense and then moved on to other jobs.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to a spreadsheet that Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. helpfully included in its recent research paper, titled “Is Nunavut education criminally inadequate?”</seg>
<seg id="46">the current Nunavut teacher employment numbers are rather less than encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="47">As of last November, the Department of Education employed 610 teachers.</seg>
<seg id="48">Of those, 429 were non-Inuit and 181 were Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="49">Among those in positions of authority, the numbers get even worse.</seg>
<seg id="50">A total of 36 principals were non-Inuit and only seven were Inuit, while 28 vice-principals were non-Inuit and only four were Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="51">Don’t forget: the NTEP program is designed to train people capable of teaching up to about Grade 6 only.</seg>
<seg id="52">For Grade 7 to Grade 12, there isn’t and never has been any identifiable program or strategy set up to train people who are able to use Inuktut as a language of instruction in those grades.</seg>
<seg id="53">Unrealistic provisions  No such program existed in 2008, when MLAs passed an Education Act that said “bilingual education” for those grades was to have been phased in between 2016-17 and 2019-20.</seg>
<seg id="54">Those who believed in that possibility were either lying to themselves and to the public, or they were seriously deluded, or they just didn’t care.</seg>
<seg id="55">That’s why we said earlier that the 2008 act was dead on arrival.</seg>
<seg id="56">It contained unrealistic provisions that were impossible to implement.</seg>
<seg id="57">So it’s understandable that leaders with organizations such as Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., and many other observers, are enraged by the GN’s failures.</seg>
<seg id="58">“Inuit children receive the majority of their education in the dominant languages instead of their mother tongue.</seg>
<seg id="59">This constitutes cultural genocide,” Aluki Kotierk, the president of NTI, said last month in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="60">But at the same time, members of the Nunavut legislature can’t afford to indulge in another exercise in unreality.</seg>
<seg id="61">As in 2017, they will be presented with a bill in which a schedule for introducing Inuktut as a language of instruction is tied to the GN’s capacity to offer it.</seg>
<seg id="62">“Timelines for implementation would be tied to targets outlined in the Department of Education’s Inuit Employment Plan,” the GN said in a recent information brochure.</seg>
<seg id="63">In other words, it will occur when the Department of Education solves its people problem.</seg>
<seg id="64">This is a difficult, complex subject and this 1,000-word editorial barely scratches its surface.</seg>
<seg id="65">But this time around, MLAs would be well-advised to hold their noses and vote in favour of Bill 25.</seg>
<seg id="66">And while they’re at it, they might also want to think about asking a question or two on that review of NTEP.</seg>

<seg id="6">On a rainy Wednesday morning in Iqaluit, about 100 Inuksuk High School students picked up cardboard signs, gathered their friends and walked out of school.</seg>
<seg id="7">They marched to the legislative assembly to call on Nunavut’s leaders to take action on climate change as part of a protest on World Environment Day, on June 5.</seg>
<seg id="8">Iqaluit-Manirajak MLA Adam Lightstone greeted the students on the steps of the legislature, announcing his support to them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Inspired by what he saw and heard from the students that morning, Lightstone directed questions later in the afternoon to the premier about the government’s actions on climate change.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Why are we the only jurisdiction in Canada that does not have an incentive program or offer rebates to encourage Nunavummiut to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels?”</seg>
<seg id="11">he asked.</seg>
<seg id="12">Savikataaq said the territory has to rely on fossil fuels because “in Nunavut we have very few, limited options.”</seg>
<seg id="13">“I’m sure the member does his part for climate change.</seg>
<seg id="14">Maybe he has a quick, warm shower instead of a hot shower…. Maybe he doesn’t take unnecessary trips to the south so that he can conserve fuel,” the premier said.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Nunavut’s share of carbon is 0.1.</seg>
<seg id="16">That’s our share in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="17">If we shut off every single light and just sat in a cold, dark room in Nunavut, Canada’s carbon share would drop by 0.1,” he added.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cassidy-Ann Netser, Angela Austria and Mac Pavia, the three Grade 12 students who organized the walkout, sat in the legislature during opening statements, but were not present for Savikataaq’s comments.</seg>
<seg id="19">The three students said they started planning the protest a few weeks ago after a class lesson about the planet’s carbon dioxide levels inspired them to take action.</seg>
<seg id="20">“Our teacher had pulled up this chart from NASA, and it showed the carbon dioxide levels in the air and it said it was at 411 parts per million.</seg>
<seg id="21">That’s the highest it’s ever been,” said Netser.</seg>
<seg id="22">The students presented a written proposal to the legislative assembly that called on the government to, among other things, create a youth advocacy group, declare a state of environmental crisis, implement a climate action plan and increase investment in clean energy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Citing the students’ proposal, Lightstone asked if the government would commit to the creation of a youth advisory council.</seg>
<seg id="24">Savikataaq said the Climate Change Secretariat is already working on a youth advisory committee and a staff member has been assigned to the project.</seg>
<seg id="25">When asked by Lightstone if the government would introduce a motion to declare a climate emergency, Savikataaq said he was unsure of the definition of “emergency.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“We live in a small corner of this world where it’s being affected the most, but a lot of the factors that affect us are happening even outside of Canada,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">“The biggest emitters are not from Canada.”</seg>
<seg id="28">The premier added that although he did not know what the declaration of a climate emergency would do, he encouraged all Nunavummiut to do their part in reducing their carbon footprint.</seg>
<seg id="29">Austria said the students will continue to push for change, and hope students in younger grades will take on their initiatives after she graduates.</seg>
<seg id="30">“The Arctic is warming at three times the global rate.</seg>
<seg id="31">I think it’s really important for us to be catalysts for change,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="32">“Because this is our home.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut’s new education, language bill does not reflect the needs of Inuit: NTI</seg>
<seg id="2">NTI says the Government of Nunavut did not sufficiently consult with it during the bill’s development</seg>

<seg id="6">Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. says the Government of Nunavut’s plans to amend the Education Act and Inuit Language Protections Act fall short of responding to what Inuit have asked for.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bill 25, “An Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act,” was tabled in the Nunavut legislature on June 5.</seg>
<seg id="8">The GN did not sufficiently engage NTI in the development of those new amendments, the Inuit birthright organization said, resulting in legislation that does not reflect Inuit objectives.</seg>
<seg id="9">While the legislation offered “a couple of modest improvements” over the GN’s last attempt to amend its Education Act—the failed Bill 37—”it was not a significant improvement,” NTI said in a June 5 release.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bill 37, which was tabled by Nunavut’s previous government, would have delayed the implementation of Inuktut instruction in Grades 4 through Grade 9 from its originally planned deadline of 2020 until 2030.</seg>
<seg id="11">The newly proposed Bill 25 would set back the full implementation of Inuktut even longer, until 2039, in recognition of teacher shortages and a lack of teaching materials.</seg>
<seg id="12">“The government must be held accountable for the failure of Bill 25 to address NTI’s most important proposals on behalf of Nunavut Inuit in a meaningful way,” said NTI President Aluki Kotierk in the release.</seg>
<seg id="13">“On this slow a schedule, a child born today—who will be 20 years old in 2039—will still not be able to receive Grades 9-12 instruction in Inuktut.”</seg>
<seg id="14">Since the territorial government first began work on amending its education and language legislation, NTI has pressed for an Inuit employment plan for educators, which would deliver on-the-job training to Inuktut-speaking teachers.</seg>
<seg id="15">NTI says Inuit want to see Inuktut as the main language taught in daycares and elementary and secondary schools in Nunavut, along with a stronger focus on Inuit Qaujimajatutangit.</seg>
<seg id="16">The birthright organization has also criticized the new legislation for reducing the role of district education authorities in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kotierk said NTI only saw the latest version of the bill the same day it was tabled.</seg>
<seg id="18">“Nunavut Inuit have been clear in their expectations for the Education Act,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">“Despite years of constructive contributions by NTI and other Nunavummiut, the Government of Nunavut appears to be offering very much the same repackaged amendments.”</seg>
<seg id="20">A recent report prepared by NTI asserted that the Nunavut’s education system, and its lack of Inuktut-language curriculum, may be “criminally inadequate” and “constitutes cultural genocide.”</seg>
<seg id="21">For its part, the GN said its latest amendments were based on consultations with hundreds of Nunavummiut, including NTI, the Coalition of Nunavut DEAs, the Commission scolaire francophone du Nunavut, the Nunavut Teachers Association, the Office of the Languages Commissioner and four student groups.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bill 25 is expected to receive its second reading in the legislature on Thursday, June 6, before it goes to the standing committee of MLAs.</seg>
<seg id="23">With the legislature adjourning its spring sitting that day, further discussion on the proposed bill will happen in the fall sitting, set to start on Oct. 17.</seg>

<seg id="1">Senators say Canada must do more, spend more in the Arctic</seg>
<seg id="2">“The Arctic’s residents are marginalized by their exclusion from investment”</seg>
<seg id="3">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="4">The Senate Special Committee on the Arctic, in a report released on June 11, calls on the federal government to spend more on Arctic infrastructure and to empower northern governments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Saying the Canadian Arctic suffers from a long history of neglect and disregard, the Special Senate Committee on the Arctic, in a report issued today, is calling on the federal government to build more, train more and spend more in northern Canada.</seg>
<seg id="6">“It is a world where the advantages of the modern world have still largely passed us by,” Conservative Senator Dennis Patterson, the committee’s chair, told reporters this morning in Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="7">That view is echoed also in the text of the committee’s report, which is built on evidence they received from multiple witnesses, including many northern and Indigenous residents of Arctic Canada who spoke to the committee during a northern tour and in hearings held in Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="8">“From food security to access to education and health care, the high cost of living, and aging or non-existent infrastructure, the Arctic’s residents are marginalized by their exclusion from investment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Canada falls even further behind when it is compared with other circumpolar countries, which make significant investments in the Arctic regions,” the report said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The people of the Canadian Arctic suffer from multiple shortfalls including poor broadband internet, high food prices, housing that is inadequate in quality and quantity, and poor education.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The best jobs too often go to southerners, because training and educational opportunities for Arctic resident are scarce,” Patterson said.</seg>
<seg id="12">An Arctic infrastructure bank?</seg>
<seg id="13">One major focus of the report is Arctic Canada’s infrastructure deficit—in transportation, energy and communications—which feeds numerous intersecting problems.</seg>
<seg id="14">“You know, Arctic growth depends on infrastructure development,” Patterson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">That need for more and better infrastructure is made more urgent by the damage done to existing infrastructure by climate change, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="16">To that end, one of the committee’s 30 recommendations calls on the federal government to work with Indigenous and territorial governments on the creation of an Arctic infrastructure bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">If created, that infrastructure bank would help finance the construction of new infrastructure and help mitigate the impact of climate change on existing infrastructure, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Numerous other recommendations focus on economic development, education and training, climate change adaptation, arts and culture, conservation, science, search and rescue, and national security.</seg>
<seg id="19">Trudeau government’s Arctic framework still not released</seg>
<seg id="20">The Senate created the special Arctic committee after passing a motion in September 2017 made by Charlie Watt, then a Liberal senator.</seg>
<seg id="21">Watt served as the Arctic committee’s first chair until he left the Senate in 2018 to take the presidency of Nunavik’s Makivik Corp.</seg>
<seg id="22">Its original purpose was to feed ideas into the Liberal government’s new Arctic policy framework, the creation of which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in December 2016.</seg>
<seg id="23">When complete, that policy framework would replace Stephen Harper’s Conservative government’s 2009 Northern Strategy and Harper’s 2010 Statement on Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy.</seg>
<seg id="24">This past February, Carolyn Bennett, the minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, said the Arctic framework would likely be released in June.</seg>
<seg id="25">And last March, Dominic LeBlanc, then the northern affairs minister, said one reason for delays in releasing the policy is that some northern “partners” are reviewing drafts of the Arctic policy framework and writing their own chapters.</seg>
<seg id="26">One of those partners is Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.</seg>
<seg id="27">In a release last week, ITK said it had “approved an Inuit Nunangat chapter” for inclusion in the Arctic policy framework.</seg>
<seg id="28">Empowerment of northern governments</seg>
<seg id="29">For their part, Patterson and the committee’s deputy chair, Independent Senator Patricia Bovey of Manitoba, said the federal government must work towards the empowerment of Indigenous and non-Indigenous northerners.</seg>
<seg id="30">“The ultimate goal, in our committee’s view, should be the eventual devolution of decision-making powers about northern issues to northern institutions—decisions about the North must be made in the North, for the North and by the North,” the two senators said in their introduction to the report.</seg>
<seg id="31">On that theme, Patterson said he’s not comfortable with the idea of the federal government using ITK as a conduit for federal funding directed towards health care and other matters.</seg>
<seg id="32">“I am very strongly in support of the Government of Nunavut being the primary deliverer of health and social and justice and housing and municipal programs in Nunavut,” Patterson said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Besides the creation of an Arctic infrastructure bank, the committee’s other recommendations include:</seg>
<seg id="34">• The creation of a federal strategy that devolves federal programs to territorial and Indigenous governments.</seg>
<seg id="35">• More money to implement comprehensive land claims agreements, and to finance land use planning and regulatory boards.</seg>
<seg id="36">• Create co-management regimes with Indigenous and territorial governments for Arctic offshore regions.</seg>
<seg id="37">• Create a consistent definition of “Arctic.”</seg>
<seg id="38">• Ask the National Research Council to create a building code adapted to Arctic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="39">• Implement an action plan to mitigate the effects of climate change on infrastructure, take immediate measures to address the housing crisis in the Arctic, and report annually to local, Indigenous and territorial governments on the effect of federal spending on housing.</seg>
<seg id="40">• Support Indigenous or territorial governments by increasing funding for adult basic education in the Arctic, ensure students can pursue studies in their Indigenous language, and support the Government of Nunavut in establishing a university in the eastern Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="41">• Spend more on the Department of Canadian Heritage’s Northern Aboriginal Broadcasting Program.</seg>
<seg id="42">• Work with local, Indigenous and territorial governments on the development of multi-use community centres for arts, culture and language.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Create ways in which Indigenous organizations can have a say in federal research and the setting of Arctic research priorities.</seg>
<seg id="44">• Invest in the development of infrastructure and Indigenous environmental stewardship initiatives that support a conservation economy.</seg>
<seg id="45">• Establish “a robust governance regime” to regulate activities in Canada’s Arctic waters, including shipping corridors and bonding and insurance requirements, with the involvement and participation of Arctic Indigenous governing bodies and communities.</seg>
<seg id="46">• Increase funding for Indigenous permanent participants on the Arctic Council.</seg>
<seg id="47">• Recognize the “urgent need” to improve search and rescue and emergency protection infrastructure in the Arctic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Savikataaq opposes plan to have the public pick Nunavut’s premiers</seg>
<seg id="2">“What we have now is the most democratic system”</seg>
<seg id="3">Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq smiles as he stands above the foyer of the Nunavut legislature in Iqaluit a year after he became the territory’s premier.</seg>
<seg id="4">“I’m proud to be premier.</seg>
<seg id="5">I love my job and the people I work with, my staff and all my cabinet members and MLAS because I know we all have to work together, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">“We all have different opinions about how we can get to the goal but we all have the same goal…. We all want to leave Nunavut in a better state than we got it.”</seg>
<seg id="7">(Photo by Jane George)</seg>
<seg id="8">By Jane George</seg>
<seg id="9">A plan being floated to have Nunavut’s premier directly chosen by voters doesn’t have the support of the person currently holding the job.</seg>
<seg id="10">“I think what we have now is the most democratic system,” said Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="11">The premier’s comment, offered in a wide-ranging interview with Nunatsiaq News, comes in reaction to an announcement by Aggu MLA Paul Quassa on June 5, the last day of the spring legislative sitting, that he would make a motion during the next sitting for a plebiscite on how Nunavut’s premier is elected.</seg>
<seg id="12">Quassa’s proposal comes one year after Nunavut’s MLAs voted to oust him as premier.</seg>
<seg id="13">His plan would see a premier chosen by eligible voters in the territory, and not, as is the case now, by MLAs in the legislative chamber.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Savikataaq said there’s no reason to change the way premiers are chosen in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Our MLAs pick the cabinet, our MLAs pick the premier for their constituents, and the premier is absolutely accountable to the MLAs, which was proven last year,” Savikataaq said in an interview timed to coincide with his 12-month anniversary as premier.</seg>
<seg id="16">A Nunavut-wide elected premier might not be accountable to the MLAs, Savikataaq suggested, adding that he didn’t know whether the MLAs could even remove the premier under that scenario.</seg>
<seg id="17">“There are more questions … it wouldn’t be a simple process,” said Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="18">“Would you have a run-off election so the premier would be picked by 50 per cent of the eligible voters? If you have 10 people (running), the odds of one person getting 50 per cent plus one is slim. Or could the premier be elected with four per cent of the popular vote?”</seg>
<seg id="19">When the Nunavut legislature has its fall sitting, Aggu MLA Paul Quassa says he plans to make a motion for a plebiscite that would seek changes to how Nunavut elects its premier. (Photo by Jane George)</seg>
<seg id="20">As well, things could be difficult if the premier came in with a mandate different from that of the MLAs.</seg>
<seg id="21">For now, the premier comes up with a plan for the government that is presented to cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="22">This then gets supported by all the MLAs.</seg>
<seg id="23">It’s not just put forward by the premier, he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">And what if a universally elected premier decided to change the government’s vision after being elected, Savikataaq asked.</seg>
<seg id="25">“What it is, is going to a party system without calling it that,” he said of Quassa’s call for a universally elected premier.</seg>
<seg id="26">“Here we run as a team.</seg>
<seg id="27">And MLAs can remove a leader and they demonstrated that they could, and they did.”</seg>
<seg id="28">Savikataaq said he and Quassa are on speaking terms.</seg>
<seg id="29">“I talk to him.</seg>
<seg id="30">We talk,” Savikataaq said.</seg>
<seg id="31">“In lot of situations like this you have to turn the page and get on with it.”</seg>
<seg id="32">Federal funds sent to ITK creates confusion</seg>
<seg id="33">A looming discussion about electoral reform is not the only challenge Savikataaq faces in his second year as premier.</seg>
<seg id="34">There’s also what he called “confusion” over money that Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami recently received from Ottawa for work in the areas of education and health—for tuberculosis prevention, early learning and child care, and tobacco reduction.</seg>
<seg id="35">These are areas in which Nunavut usually delivers services as a public government.</seg>
<seg id="36">ITK has also produced a strategy on Inuit needs for more social housing, which the Nunavut Housing Corp. now oversees.</seg>
<seg id="37">Concerns about how the Government of Nunavut would work with Inuit organizations on housing also came up in the legislature on June 3, when Arviat North-Whale Cove MLA John Main asked whether the GN has a system to direct future collaboration with these organizations.</seg>
<seg id="38">But there isn’t and “it’s a confusing time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Because we’re not exactly sure how it’s going to work out,” Savikataaq said.</seg>
<seg id="40">Savikataaq said ITK has told him they don’t want to be a service provider—but Savikataaq said he’s shared his concerns with the prime minister about the money going to ITK.</seg>
<seg id="41">Right now, by law, the GN is the service provider to everyone in the territory, he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">If the GN is no longer going to be a public government, then you’d have to open the Nunavut land claims agreement, he said.</seg>
<seg id="43">MMIWG report helps build case for more housing money</seg>
<seg id="44">Between the GN’s own Blueprint for Action on Housing and the recommendation for more housing in the report by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, “we have a more convincing case for the feds to do something,” Savikataaq said.</seg>
<seg id="45">As for the MMIWG report, now being looked at by Nunavut’s family services department, Savikataaq said there’s only one way to meet that recommendation for more housing, that is, with more federal funding for it.</seg>
<seg id="46">“We need 3,000-plus houses.</seg>
<seg id="47">For 2019-20 we have enough money to build 83,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="48">“Do the math: we can’t do it on our own.</seg>
<seg id="49">We don’t have the resources.”</seg>
<seg id="50">At their annual joint meeting, on Thursday and Friday in Dawson City, Yukon, the three premiers also plan to discuss mental health and addictions, climate change and sustainable development, energy, transportation and sustainable infrastructure.  The premiers also want to ensure that the territories play a big role in the new Arctic Strategy and Framework, Savikataaq said—which ITK has said it also wants.</seg>
<seg id="51">Addictions treatment, elder care remain priorities  Meanwhile, as Savikataaq nears his one-year mark in office, he said he’s proud to be premier and loves his job.</seg>
<seg id="52">He’s full of praise for his team of staff, cabinet members and MLAs.</seg>
<seg id="53">“Everyone works together.</seg>
<seg id="54">It’s a bit slower process than we’d like for the treatment centre and bringing the elders back,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are two priorities that the premier said he wanted to work on when interviewed last August.</seg>
<seg id="56">But Savikataaq said his government has its mandate and they know what they want to get done.</seg>
<seg id="57">“It takes time to get done what we want to do because of the process of budgeting and the financing,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="58">“We’re still working towards a treatment centre and an elders home and we’re closer than we have ever been, but we’re not quite there yet.”</seg>

<seg id="9">The current IIBA, which replaced the first agreement signed in 2013, was signed last October.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the negotiations for this IIBA took place before Baffinland had filed its revised proposal with the Nunavut Impact Review Board to boost its operations in north Baffin.</seg>
<seg id="11">And that deal was reached before the QIA realized how the mining company’s expansion might affect Inuit and the environment.</seg>
<seg id="12">This became clearer during the second technical meeting called for this week by the NIRB on Baffinland’s project proposal.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the short term, Baffinland wants to build a 110-kilometre railway in north Baffin, double its ore production to 12 million tonnes a year and extend the length of its shipping season from July 1 to Nov. 15 to accommodate about 175 transits of big ore-carrying ships.</seg>
<seg id="14">The railway to the north of Mary River would likely start operating by 2021 and accommodate a total fleet of five locomotives and 200 cars.</seg>
<seg id="15">Building it would require multiple quarries and at least 12.7 million cubic metres of rock-fill.</seg>
<seg id="16">This map shows the full extent of the company’s future expansion plans: one railway running north to Milne Inlet and another running south to Steensby Inlet, with eventual annual production of 30 million tonnes of iron ore per year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Participants at the meeting also shared observations of what they said were impacts due to the mine’s current shipping and mine operations: dislocation of narwhals last summer away from Pond Inlet and dust problems inland that are so visible that a normally white-coloured fox turned pink from red iron ore dust.</seg>
<seg id="18">Barnabas said the QIA will continue to work with Baffinland.</seg>
<seg id="19">But he said the technical meeting left him with many concerns and no time left to fully discuss them.</seg>
<seg id="20">The role of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit continues to be the central concern of the QIA, which presented a report on IQ linked to the area around the mine during the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of Inuit knowledge is “vital,” Barnabas said, adding that IQ should be the lens through which Baffinland assesses the mine.</seg>
<seg id="22">That was picked up in closing comments from Frank Tester, an advisor to Pond Inlet on the Baffinland project, who said Pond Inlet supports the QIA’s call to reopen the IIBA.</seg>
<seg id="23">Tester, a researcher known for his previous studies of the impacts of mining in Nunavut’s Kivalliq region, then delivered a list citing Baffinland’s shortfalls in many areas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Tester said IQ is “inadequate,” “poorly understood” and “improperly” used by Baffinland.</seg>
<seg id="25">He said its social and cultural research, which he called out for a lack of inclusion of women, families and food security, is “inadequate.”</seg>
<seg id="26">As for the cumulative effects assessment, Tester said it was “problematic” and that climate change hadn’t been properly assessed.</seg>
<seg id="27">He also said Pond Inlet had serious concerns about the development of the proposed railway.</seg>
<seg id="28">Other issues raised by Inuit around the table in their final comments included the need for better protection and preservation of archeological sites, as well as more contracting opportunities and involvement for the smaller communities closest to the mine.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now Baffinland has three months to placate the QIA, resolve outstanding issues, such as how caribou will manage to cross the railway, provide information that various participants at the meeting requested and prepare for the final public hearing on the phase-two proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This hearing was to take place in Pond Inlet in mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="31">But due to the number of expected participants and the shortage of places to stay in the community, the hearing will now take place in both Pond Inlet and in Iqaluit, the NIRB’s executive director said.</seg>
<seg id="32">The dates for the two hearings have been pushed back, to Sept. 23 to Sept. 27 in Pond Inlet and Sept. 30 to Oct. 4 in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="33">The hearing in Pond Inlet will focus on participation by local communities and groups.</seg>
<seg id="34">The hearing in Iqaluit will include additional participants and feature a community roundtable with five representatives invited from each of the communities of Igloolik, Hall Beach, Clyde River, Pond Inlet, Arctic Bay, Resolute Bay and Grise Fiord.</seg>
<seg id="35">The NIRB is also planning to make a site visit to the Mary River mine before the hearings.</seg>
<seg id="36">The changes to the initial plans for the final hearing mean the NIRB’s report with recommendations on Baffinland’s expansion will go to ministers in Ottawa about three weeks after the Oct. 21 federal election.</seg>

<seg id="2">Health and social services will be a priority in discussions, Makivik says</seg>

<seg id="6">Nunavik’s Makivik Corp. has signed an agreement with the federal government that serves as a framework for negotiations towards an Inuit self-government for the region.</seg>
<seg id="7">The agreement was signed June 18 by Makivik President Charlie Watt and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett.</seg>
<seg id="8">The MOU, in development since last fall, outlines Makivik’s objectives, a timeline for discussions, a work plan, dispute resolution and funding.</seg>
<seg id="9">In an email to Nunatsiaq News, a spokesperson with CIRNA called the document “a starting point for discussions that will cover many topics on self-determination and governance.”</seg>
<seg id="10">Earlier this year, Makivik appointed a chief negotiator, Mary Simon, to chair the Nunavik Inuit constitutional task force.</seg>
<seg id="11">Its mandate is to spell out the creation and role of an Inuit government in Nunavik based on Inuit values, heritage, identity, culture and language.</seg>
<seg id="12">“I am very eager to begin the discussions and negotiations,” Simon said, following the MOU’s signing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those negotiations will largely be focused at a main table, Simon explained, with sectoral forums to discuss specific issues.</seg>
<seg id="14">“We have agreed to tackle community and family well-being as an urgent topic to ensure that Nunavik Inuit receive the health and social services that all Canadians expect and to provide economic opportunities that we so desperately need,” she said in a June 19 release.</seg>
<seg id="15">Now that Makivik has an MOU in place with Ottawa, its next task will be to enter into a similar agreement with the Quebec government.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simon said last month that Nunavik Inuit are not asking the government for anything, but rather negotiating “to bring back the authority that has been taken” from the region.</seg>
<seg id="17">The task force is working to prepare a draft of the Nunavik Inuit government constitution, to be presented to an all-organizations meeting this fall.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federal government is currently working with Indigenous groups at 80 Recognition of Indigenous Rights and Self-Determination discussion tables across the country, with a goal “to explore new ways of working together to advance the recognition of Indigenous rights and self-determination,” CIRNA said.</seg>

<seg id="1">A direct election for Nunavut premier?</seg>
<seg id="2">Look before you leap</seg>
<seg id="3">There are no options for a directly elected premier in which regular MLAs do not lose power</seg>
<seg id="4">Should Nunavut MLAs choose to hold a plebiscite on whether Nunavut’s premier should be chosen in a Nunavut-wide election?</seg>
<seg id="5">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="6">Some people believe the best way to improve the quality of territorial government in Nunavut is to start using a direct, public vote to choose the premier.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of them is Aggu MLA Paul Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nunavut MLAs gave him the premiership on Nov. 17, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="9">In just seven months, on June 14, 2018, the same group of MLAs took the job away from him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Quassa is advancing a proposal that could permanently weaken the power of regular MLAs and make it far more difficult, and perhaps impossible, for them to remove a premier in the future.</seg>
<seg id="11">He’s given notice that this fall, he plans to ask the same MLAs who removed him from the premiership to support a Nunavut-wide plebiscite on the question of whether Nunavut’s premier should be directly elected.</seg>
<seg id="12">In support of this idea, Quassa points to the work of the Nunavut Implementation Commission in the mid-1990s.</seg>
<seg id="13">That’s the long-forgotten 10-member body that created the first blueprints for Nunavut’s public government, under the terms of a long-forgotten agreement called the Nunavut Political Accord.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 1996, they recommended that a Nunavut premier should be directly elected in a Nunavut-wide vote to be held prior to legislative assembly elections, and that such a premier should have the power to hire and fire their own ministers.</seg>
<seg id="15">So Quassa is correct.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunavut commission put lot of work into looking at a system for the direct election of a premier.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their favoured option was actually drawn from a list of 12.</seg>
<seg id="18">The commission did this because, at that time, there was deep, widespread dissatisfaction with the territorial government everywhere in the Northwest Territories, including within the three regions that later formed Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="19">Elected people at all levels, including MLAs, territorial cabinet ministers and officials with Indigenous organizations, were producing multiple gaffes, scandals and outrages, many related to domestic violence, alcohol abuse, and the abuse of women and children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Voters on either side of the division boundary were deeply frustrated.</seg>
<seg id="21">The non-partisan consensus system did not appear to offer a way of expressing that dissatisfaction in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the three parties to the Nunavut Political Accord—Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. and the governments of Canada and the Northwest Territories—did not adopt the idea of a directly elected government leader and left the decision to the future Nunavut legislature.</seg>
<seg id="23">It didn’t take long for Nunavut’s first group of MLAs to make up their minds.</seg>
<seg id="24">In March of 1999, they chose a premier and cabinet from among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="25">And in June 1999, at a caucus retreat in Baker Lake, MLAs decided to stick with that system.</seg>
<seg id="26">“Caucus agreed that the current method of selection of the premier will remain in place to ensure that the holder of the position is accountable at all times to the elected members of the legislative assembly,” they said in a statement issued on June 17, 1999. (The italics are ours.)</seg>
<seg id="27">No surprise there.</seg>
<seg id="28">Every one of the Nunavut commission’s 12 options would have seen the regular MLA caucus lose power and influence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Indeed, there are no options for a directly elected premier in which regular MLAs—and the small Nunavut communities and regions that many of them represent—would not lose power and influence.</seg>
<seg id="30">That brings us to today.</seg>
<seg id="31">Just last month, regular MLAs doubled down on the principle that their predecessors asserted in 1999, insisting the premier and cabinet are accountable to the public only through the work of regular MLAs.</seg>
<seg id="32">“Regular members are responsible for effectively holding the government accountable to the people of Nunavut through our scrutiny of the government’s budgets, business plans, bills and policies,” they said, in a gruff letter of warning signed by John Main, the chair of the regular members’ caucus.</seg>
<seg id="33">This suggests that if he wants his colleagues in the legislature to support the idea of an elected premier, Quassa has a tough hill to climb.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even Premier Joe Savikataaq says he’s opposed to it.</seg>
<seg id="35">That’s not a judgment on the merits of Quassa’s plebiscite proposal, which he made, obviously, in good faith.</seg>
<seg id="36">It simply means political realities could prevent such a plebiscite from ever being held.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, if MLAs, or the cabinet, do decide to leap into a plebiscite on the question of a directly elected premier, they must do so with their eyes wide open.</seg>
<seg id="38">And they absolutely must provide the public with a specific, detailed proposal setting out how such a system would work.</seg>
<seg id="39">Simply asking people whether or not they want a directly elected premier wouldn’t be good enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">That’s because the greatest danger posed by a directly elected government leader is that, without sufficient safeguards, the system could create a four-year dictatorship run by an unaccountable, bullying demagogue.</seg>
<seg id="41">So a description of those safeguards, in the form of a detailed proposal, must be built into any plebiscite question.</seg>
<seg id="42">Keep in mind that the winner of such a vote wouldn’t really be a “premier” anymore.</seg>
<seg id="43">Such a system would create a new type of position, similar to that of a U.S. state governor, moving Nunavut towards American-style republicanism.</seg>
<seg id="44">There, the head of the executive branch of government—the governor and cabinet—do not sit in the state legislature.</seg>
<seg id="45">It would likely create a stronger executive branch, empowering ministers, deputy ministers and the rest of the bureaucracy.</seg>
<seg id="46">At the same time, it would weaken MLAs and their legislative committees.</seg>
<seg id="47">Given that vote-rich Baffin would likely dominate a Nunavut-wide election, this idea might also weaken and permanently marginalize smaller regions like the Kitikmeot.</seg>
<seg id="48">Is that what Nunavut residents really want?</seg>
<seg id="49">And who would be eligible to run for premier?</seg>
<seg id="50">Any adult resident?</seg>
<seg id="51">Sitting MLAs only?</seg>
<seg id="52">Above all, how would MLAs get rid of a directly elected premier who abuses their power or engages in unethical behaviour?</seg>
<seg id="53">And when would the election for premier be held?</seg>
<seg id="54">In the period prior to a general election of members?</seg>
<seg id="55">After a general election?</seg>
<seg id="56">Also, it’s essential that such a system provide for a second run-off vote between the top two finishers of the first vote to ensure a candidate gets least 50 per cent of the vote before being declared premier.</seg>
<seg id="57">If the legislative assembly can’t provide detailed answers to these and other questions prior to a plebiscite, then they shouldn’t hold one.</seg>
<seg id="58">Meanwhile, there’s a simpler solution to the question of how to choose a premier on a Nunavut-wide basis.</seg>
<seg id="59">And that is to abandon the current non-partisan system and embrace a party system.</seg>
<seg id="60">But that may not be a good fit for Nunavut either.</seg>
<seg id="61">Stay tuned for an editorial on that subject soon.</seg>

<seg id="1">Government of Nunavut touts its long-awaited, revised Corrections Act</seg>
<seg id="2">“It has made for a better bill for the inmate population”</seg>
<seg id="3">Construction is now underway in Iqaluit of the new Qikiqtani Correctional Healing Centre, which will replace the controversial Baffin Correctional Centre.</seg>

<seg id="5">By Sarah Rogers</seg>
<seg id="6">The Government of Nunavut says its new corrections legislation is more transparent, Inuit-focused and responsive to the needs of inmates in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bill 1, Nunavut’s Corrections Act, received assent earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="8">One of the main pieces of the legislation is the creation of a new investigations officer, responsible for review and oversight.</seg>
<seg id="9">The legislation also provides for new limits on segregation, counselling for inmates by elders and reporting on disciplinary hearings.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nunavut’s new corrections act was a long time coming; it was originally inherited from the Northwest Territories where it was first drafted in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="11">The GN launched consultations in 2016 to gather input to draft its own act.</seg>
<seg id="12">But once the proposed legislation was introduced to the legislature in 2017, it died on the order paper when the assembly dissolved before the territorial elections that year.</seg>
<seg id="13">The re-introduced legislation is largely the same bill that was introduced two years ago, with an emphasis on grievance procedures and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, said Bill MacKay, deputy minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="14">“The process has taken a while, but we had a lot of input over the course of the last few years,” MacKay said.</seg>
<seg id="15">“At the end of the day, it has made for a better bill for the inmate population and for Nunavummiut as a whole.”</seg>
<seg id="16">But it will take some time to see the results of the new legislation, which won’t come into effect until the new investigations officer and deputy officer roles are filled.</seg>
<seg id="17">That will likely take a year, MacKay said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Both of those positions will provide oversight independent of the GN, though their decisions will be referred back to the director of corrections to ultimately act on.</seg>
<seg id="19">Officers can review and make decisions on inmates in administrative segregation, which can either be imposed by corrections staff or requested by inmates for safety reasons, as well as in cases of disciplinary segregation, which are decided as a result of a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">Inmates can then ask for a review on those decisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">While there was previously no set timeline for when that review would have to happen for inmates in disciplinary segregation, notice must now be given within a 24-hour period.</seg>
<seg id="22">Among the other reforms introduced in the new bill are the following:</seg>
<seg id="23">• a requirement to flag an inmate’s mental health issues as a health issue (and not a safety one) and to refer inmates to mental health services</seg>
<seg id="24">• a formal grievance procedure</seg>
<seg id="25">• a requirement to produce annual reports, including information on disciplinary hearings</seg>
<seg id="26">• a minimum amount of Inuit-focused programming, including the availability of elders for counselling as requested</seg>
<seg id="27">• the creation of an Inuit Society Values Committee, whose members would be appointed based on nominations from Inuit organizations, to guide the use of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit</seg>
<seg id="28">Because the previous legislation came from Northwest Territories, it wasn’t Inuit-focused, MacKay said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now all corrections policies and directives must be reviewed by that committee.</seg>
<seg id="30">“We wanted to make sure that it was a key part of this legislation,” he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">“It’s always been an issue on people’s minds”</seg>
<seg id="3">Iqaluit city council passed a motion on Tuesday night to develop a ban on single-use plastic bags in the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">Coun. Kyle Sheppard, who introduced the motion, said he hopes the bylaw will be put into effect by January 2020.</seg>

<seg id="7">Plastic bags in Nunavut’s capital may soon be a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="8">Iqaluit city council passed a motion on Tuesday night to write a bylaw banning the use of plastic bags in the city’s retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="9">Coun. Kyle Sheppard tabled the motion, which passed with unanimous support from council.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sheppard says the motion is something Iqaluit residents have expressed interest in for a long time, but the recent community cleanup day inspired him to bring it to council.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Anybody involved in the community cleanup can comment on the number of plastic bags found throughout town, lying in our creeks.</seg>
<seg id="12">It’s always been an issue on people’s minds,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not the first time such a bylaw has been proposed by the city.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2008, Iqaluit city council drafted a similar bylaw to eliminate single-use plastic bags.</seg>
<seg id="15">Under that bylaw, retailers would not have been allowed to hand out plastic bags, but could offer paper bags or reusable bags for a fee.</seg>
<seg id="16">Plastic bags could still be used to package meat, fish and produce.</seg>
<seg id="17">Retailers who violated the ban were to be fined $100.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the 2008 bylaw received support from city council at the time, it was held up in third reading and was never put in place.</seg>
<seg id="19">“We’re trying to rectify and revive that process from 11 years ago,” Sheppard said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Beyond the plastic in the city’s streets, Sheppard said harvesters have told him about finding plastics inside the stomachs of animals hunted in the area.</seg>
<seg id="21">“Anytime you’re boating now, you can see plastic bags floating under the water.</seg>
<seg id="22">I think banning them now would be a good step in preventing some of that waste going forward.”</seg>
<seg id="23">Sheppard said he realizes a ban on plastic bags also raises the question: Why not ban all plastic in Iqaluit?</seg>
<seg id="24">“In the bigger scheme of things, all plastics are an issue. But locally, we don’t have a straw problem.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have a plastic bag problem.”</seg>
<seg id="26">There have been other efforts to curb Iqaluit’s plastic use.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, Northmart started charging customers 25 cents per plastic bag, a policy that still applies today.</seg>
<seg id="28">Northmart saw a 60 per cent reduction in plastic bags handed out in its Nunavut and Nunavik stores after introducing the charge.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Northwest Company, which owns Northmart, donated the money collected from bag sales to programs such as school breakfasts, community cleanups and scholarships.</seg>
<seg id="30">Arctic Ventures, Iqaluit’s other major grocery store, started a 10-cent-a-bag charge in 2008 and immediately saw a drop of 30 to 40 per cent in the number of plastic bags it handed out to customers.</seg>
<seg id="31">Both Northmart and Ventures handed out free reusable bags to customers before moving to charging them for single-use plastic bags, to encourage people to step away from plastic.</seg>
<seg id="32">Baffin Canners and the Baffin Gas bar use corn-based biodegradable bags.</seg>
<seg id="33">The federal government also announced its plans earlier this year to ban single-use plastics, including bags, as early as 2021.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sheppard is hopeful the bylaw will pass this time around.</seg>
<seg id="35">“I’m very hopeful.</seg>
<seg id="36">I know I’ve heard from a lot of residents before and after the motion was made.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nothing but support so far.”</seg>
<seg id="38">City administration will write the bylaw in consultation with council members and is expected to bring it back for first reading in the next couple of months, Sheppard said.</seg>
<seg id="39">Sheppard said he hopes the bylaw, if it passes, will be in effect by January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="40">Debate on a bylaw happens after second reading, where council can then make changes or recommendations, Sheppard said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ludy Pudluk, 76, dies on Canada Day</seg>
<seg id="2">Veteran MLA remembered as “one of the driving forces behind the creation of Nunavut”</seg>
<seg id="3">Ludy Pudluk in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="4">The veteran HIgh Arctic MLA and mayor died on July 1 at the age of 76.</seg>
<seg id="5">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="6">Nunavut and Northwest Territories leaders are paying tribute to one of Nunavut’s longest-serving elected leaders, Ludy Pudluk, who died on July 1 at the age of 76, following a long illness.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pudluk was born on Jan. 31, 1943, at an outpost camp called Qaumarjuit on Navy Board Inlet, near Mittimatalik, or Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1958, he moved with his father’s family to Resolute Bay, where he lived for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="9">He told the Qikiqtani Truth Commission that at the age of 16 or 17 he attended school for two or three years in Resolute Bay and learned English by doing work at the Royal Canadian Air Force base there.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pudluk, whose English surname has also been spelled as “Padluk,” gave more than an hour of testimony to the truth commission in 2008. Readers many find the video recording here.</seg>
<seg id="11">From 1975 to 1991, he was elected four times to serve as a member of the legislative assembly of the Northwest Territories, representing the High Arctic constituency.</seg>
<seg id="12">After the electoral district’s name changed to Quttiktuq, he won re-election in 1991 and served as a territorial MLA until 1995.</seg>
<seg id="13">He also served as minister of government services in the Government of the Northwest Territories. John Quirke, now the clerk of the Nunavut legislature, served as Pudluk’s deputy minister at that time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Following his 20-year career as an MLA, Pudluk served as mayor of Resolute Bay and participated in other local organizations.</seg>
<seg id="15">“I was saddened to hear of the passing of Ludy Pudluk, member of the Order of Nunavut and MLA for the High Arctic in the Northwest Territories legislative assembly from 1975 to 1995,” Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq said in a statement posted on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="16">“I’m wishing his loved ones peace and remembering his contributions to Nunavut today,” Savikataaq said.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a joint statement, the Speakers of the Nunavut and N.W.T. legislatures also say they mourn Pudluk’s passing.</seg>
<seg id="18">“Mr. Pudluk was a dedicated spokesperson for the North, was a strong climate change activist, and made significant contributions to the creation of Nunavut,” Jackson Lafferty, the Speaker of the N.W.T. assembly, said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nunavut’s Speaker, Simeon Mikkungwak, expressed similar sentiments.</seg>
<seg id="20">“Ludy Pudluk received the Order of Nunavut last year in recognition of his lifetime of public service.</seg>
<seg id="21">My colleagues and I join his family, friends and former constituents in mourning his passing,” Mikkungwak said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nunavut Senator Dennis Patterson, along with other Nunavut MLAs who sat in the N.W.T. legislature, like the late Mark Evaluardjuk, Ipeelie Kilabuk and Joe Arlooktoo, worked with Pudluk for many years.</seg>
<seg id="23">“Today we mourn the death of one of Nunavut’s foremost elder statesmen, who was known as the dean of the assembly at the time of his retirement in 1995, for his five terms representing the High Arctic in the Northwest Territories,” Patterson said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Ludy was respected by all his colleagues as a wise, humble man with a strong vision for Nunavut and an ever-present sense of humour,” Patterson said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Last year, the Nunavut legislature honoured Pudluk by inducting him into the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="26">In a speech he gave last year at Pudluk’s investiture ceremony, Patterson praised the work of Pudluk and other members of the Nunavut caucus of the N.W.T. legislature.</seg>
<seg id="27">“Those of us who were in the N.W.T. legislative assembly during those critical years know that without the support of the N.W.T. assembly, Nunavut would never have happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">“It was the combined pressure from TFN [Tungavik Federation of Nunavut] but also the elected legislative assembly of those years, which pushed Ottawa to agree to divide the N.W.T. in 1993,” Patterson said.</seg>
<seg id="29">“Ludy Pudluk, I salute you for your leadership and your endurance as one of the driving forces behind the creation of Nunavut.”  On the day of Pudluk’s memorial service, flags will be lowered to half-mast at the legislative assembly building in Yellowknife.</seg>

<seg id="3">A Nunavut judge has ruled that the Supreme Court of Canada’s Gladue decision does not apply to bail hearings.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="5">Contrary to what some judges in other parts of the country have found, Justice Paul Bychok of Nunavut ruled last November that the Supreme Court of Canada’s famous Gladue decision does not apply to bail hearings.</seg>
<seg id="6">“As I have stated, extending the spirit of Gladue to pre-trial bail is not supported by statutory law or properly grounded judicial precedent,” Bychok said.</seg>
<seg id="7">He issued the ruling on Nov. 29, 2018, after Chris Jaypoody, 38, of Clyde River, who then faced a second-degree murder charge, had applied for bail.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bail hearings are usually covered by a temporary publication ban.</seg>
<seg id="9">That means that while a case is before the court, it’s illegal for media to report things that are said at the bail hearing, including the judge’s reasons for making a bail decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Jaypoody’s case, that ban was lifted this past June 27, when a different judge, Justice Susan Cooper, sentenced Jaypoody to four years in prison on a manslaughter conviction.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the same day, with the ban no longer in place, the Nunavut court released the full text of Bychok’s 25-page bail decision.</seg>
<seg id="12">In it, Bychok agreed that Jaypoody is neither a flight risk nor at risk of re-offending.</seg>
<seg id="13">Judge says no to Crown, defence</seg>
<seg id="14">But he denied Jaypoody’s bid for bail, on the grounds that releasing him would damage public confidence in the administration of justice, especially within Clyde River.</seg>
<seg id="15">In doing so, he rejected submissions from Crown and defence lawyers, who agreed Jaypoody ought to be released while awaiting trial and posed no threat to public safety.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ilan Neuman, Jaypoody’s defence lawyer, proposed Jaypoody be released into the supervision of Jaypoody’s 56-year-old mother and his 70-year-old stepfather, who would act as sureties.</seg>
<seg id="17">Under that plan, Jaypoody would live with them at their home.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lawyer representing the Crown that day, Moray Welch, did not oppose Jaypoody’s pre-trial release, and suggested a curfew from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. every day, and that each surety post $1,000.</seg>
<seg id="19">And, according to Bychok, the Crown lawyer said releasing Jaypoody into the community would not shock the people of Clyde River, because of “the scale of what transpires in this territory on a regular basis.”</seg>
<seg id="20">But Bychok shot back, calling that a “startling assertion,” saying domestic and family violence in Nunavut should not be normalized because of its frequency.</seg>
<seg id="21">“The staggering frequency of domestic and family violence—what Crown Counsel called ‘regular’—does not make domestic and family violence, indeed homicides, in our homes somehow unremarkable,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">“I do not share the prosecution’s perspective on domestic and family-related homicides in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="23">In my respectful view, news of any pre-trial release for Mr. Jaypoody would seriously undermine reasonable public confidence that the justice system takes domestic and family violence seriously.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gladue does not apply to bail, judge says</seg>
<seg id="25">And in a section of his judgment that goes on for at least five pages, Bychok also rejected a submission from defence lawyer Neuman asserting that judges should consider Gladue principles at bail hearings.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the Gladue decision, which dates to 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada said that in sentencing Indigenous offenders, courts must take their special circumstances into account.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bychok said that when the Supreme Court did this, they did not create “new law.”</seg>
<seg id="28">They simply interpreted an existing law on sentencing principles for Indigenous people that Parliament had added to the Criminal Code in 1996.</seg>
<seg id="29">But Parliament, at that time, chose not to apply those principles to bail hearings, Bychok said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Judges can’t override Parliament</seg>
<seg id="31">“In my view, there is no jurisdiction—or authority—for judges to override Parliament’s will in this area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Stated differently, there is no legal foundation on which judges may assume and find that Gladue sentencing considerations apply to pre-trial bail law,” Bychok said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even though some judges have tried to extend the reach of the Gladue decision by injecting “new judge-made considerations into the statutory pre-trial bail framework,” Bychok said he won’t do that.</seg>
<seg id="34">So Neuman’s request for “a new set of judge-made pre-trial bail considerations in Nunavut” won’t fly, Bychok said.</seg>
<seg id="35">“I cannot do so.</seg>
<seg id="36">In my respectful view, this is a task for Parliament and not the judiciary,” Bychok said.</seg>
<seg id="37">In an interview, Neuman said he respects Bychok’s decision, but he also said other judges have expressed different opinions.</seg>
<seg id="38">“I am not criticizing Justice Bychok, but there have been other views as to how to approach it,” Neuman said.</seg>
<seg id="39">For example, a guidebook published by the Legal Services Society of British Columbia, which contains material contributed by lawyer Jonathan Rudin of Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto, advises people to get a Gladue report to help them get a favourable bail decision.</seg>
<seg id="40">Bill C-75 changes bail rules</seg>
<seg id="41">Meanwhile, Bychok’s position on Gladue and bail hearings may soon become irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="42">That’s because of Bill C-75, a set of changes to the Criminal Code that received royal assent this past June 21.</seg>
<seg id="43">One of those changes effectively requires that judges take Gladue principles into account when making bail decisions.</seg>
<seg id="44">A summary of the new provisions, which will come into force this fall, says that in bail decisions, judges must pay attention to the circumstances of Indigenous accused persons.</seg>
<seg id="45">And judges must also pay special attention to those who “belong to a vulnerable population that is overrepresented in the criminal justice system and that is disadvantaged in obtaining release under this Part.”</seg>
<seg id="46">At the same time, Bill C-75 contains a provision that could work against accused persons in Nunavut, given Nunavut’s high rates of family violence: a “reverse onus” requirement for those accused of intimate partner violence.</seg>
<seg id="47">A “reverse onus” means it’s up to the accused person to show cause for why they should be released on bail.</seg>
<seg id="48">With lesser offences, it’s the Crown that must show cause.</seg>
<seg id="49">Another amendment in Bill C-75 that could raise Nunavut’s incarceration rates is a provision that increases sentences for those convicted of repeat offences involving intimate partner violence.</seg>
<seg id="50">Nunavut has the highest per capita rate of violent crime in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="51">Meanwhile, Bychok is not the only person who has resisted the expansion of Gladue principles in the courts.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the past, activists within Indigenous women’s groups, such as Pauktuutit, have alleged the Gladue decision produces lenient sentences for Indigenous men convicted of assaulting or abusing Indigenous women.</seg>
<seg id="53">And the recent report of the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls contains potentially conflicting messages for policy-makers.</seg>
<seg id="54">In one recommendation, they call upon federal, provincial and territorial governments to recognize the production of Gladue reports as “a right.”</seg>
<seg id="55">But in another recommendation, they call upon federal, provincial and territorial governments to thoroughly evaluate the impacts of Gladue principles “as it relates to violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people.”</seg>
<seg id="56">In Nunavut, 55 per cent of incarcerated people are remanded prisoners who can’t get bail.</seg>
<seg id="57">So it remains to be seen whether all these recent changes will reduce or increase Nunavut’s high incarceration rates.</seg>

<seg id="1">Can Nunavut afford to pay for political parties?</seg>
<seg id="2">Cash-poor Nunavut could be vulnerable to sleaze and corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">The seven-member Nunavut cabinet chosen at the start of the third legislative assembly in 2008 wait to be sworn in on Nov. 19, 2008.</seg>
<seg id="4">The assembly chose an eighth minister in early 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="6">For those who believe Nunavut’s ready to choose a premier by way of a direct, pan-territorial public vote, instead of a vote held only among MLAs, there are likely many ways to bring that about.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Nunavut Implementation Commission investigated the issue in 1996, and, though dated, many of their observations are still valid. You can find their report embedded at the bottom of this editorial.</seg>
<seg id="8">But all those options would require complicated sets of changes to the rules and conventions under which the Nunavut legislature defines the relationship among MLAs, the premier and the executive council.</seg>
<seg id="9">That doesn’t mean it can’t be done.</seg>
<seg id="10">But some believe there’s an easier way to get there.</seg>
<seg id="11">And that is for Nunavut to encourage and embrace a system of territorial political parties.</seg>
<seg id="12">That wouldn’t be quite the same as choosing a premier in a direct territory-wide vote.</seg>
<seg id="13">But that’s how it’s perceived, and in matters of political legitimacy, it’s often perception that counts.</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, many Canadians likely believe that in 2015, they elected Justin Trudeau to serve as prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="15">But they actually didn’t.</seg>
<seg id="16">They elected 338 MPs and Justin Trudeau was only one of them.</seg>
<seg id="17">He became prime minister for two reasons.</seg>
<seg id="18">One, in 2013 a private political organization called the Liberal Party of Canada chose him as their leader.</seg>
<seg id="19">Two, in 2015, 184 people loyal to that party were elected, representing a majority of the 338 seats in the House of Commons.</seg>
<seg id="20">And it’s that Liberal majority in the House of Commons—now comprising 177 MPs—to whom Trudeau owes his job, at least until the next national election.</seg>
<seg id="21">Under the unwritten conventions of the Constitution, Trudeau governs because of their support and not because of yours.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the party system makes people feel as if they chose Trudeau to lead the national government, and it’s that perception that matters.</seg>
<seg id="23">Which brings us to Nunavut, where there are no legal or constitutional barriers standing in the way of a party system.</seg>
<seg id="24">So if you want to create a territorial political party for Nunavut, go right ahead.</seg>
<seg id="25">Round up 22 candidates willing to run under your party banner in the next territorial election.</seg>
<seg id="26">But early on, you’ll run into a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">How do you pay for it?</seg>
<seg id="28">In particular, how would you pay for an election campaign?</seg>
<seg id="29">How do you pay for websites, telephones, internet, posters, signs, buttons, brochures and advertisements?</seg>
<seg id="30">Above all, how do you pay for the enormous cost of mounting a party leader’s tour throughout all or most of Nunavut’s communities?</seg>
<seg id="31">For every political party in Canada at every level, their lifeblood is money, money given to them by large numbers of individual persons, corporations and unions.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Yukon territory offers a useful comparison. Yes, culturally and demographically, Yukon does not resemble Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="33">But the size of its population, about 40,000 or so, is roughly equal to Nunavut’s, and its legislature is made up of only 19 MLAs, even fewer than Nunavut’s.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Yukon’s legislators are organized into political parties.</seg>
<seg id="35">This means their financial disclosures, released by Elections Yukon, give us a rough idea of how much it costs to run partisan election campaigns in a territory that’s roughly comparable in population size and capacity to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Yukon’s last territorial election, in 2016, the Yukon Liberal Party gained power by winning 11 of 19 seats.</seg>
<seg id="37">To do that, they spent $254,774.93, Elections Yukon reported.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second-place Yukon Party, which took six seats, spent $215,139.14. To win two seats, the third-place Yukon New Democratic Party spent $229,455.77.</seg>
<seg id="39">The tiny Yukon Green Party, which won no seats, spent only $4,118.50.</seg>
<seg id="40">This tells us that to run a credible territorial election campaign for a population of around 40,000 people, you’ll have to raise at least $200,000 to $250,000.</seg>
<seg id="41">So how did Yukon’s political parties raise that money?</seg>
<seg id="42">Through donations of course—within a system that imposes very few rules.</seg>
<seg id="43">In Nunavut, no person, business or group may contribute more than $2,500 to a territorial election candidate.</seg>
<seg id="44">Also, such donors must be based only in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="45">Out-of-territory contributions are forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="46">But in Yukon, it’s wide open.</seg>
<seg id="47">For example, a Vancouver-based mining company called Copper North Mining Corp. gave the Yukon Liberals a $50,000 donation in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="48">That single donation accounts for nearly one-fifth of the party’s election spending that year.</seg>
<seg id="49">And another B.C.-based firm, called Victoria Gold Corp, gave the Yukon Party $10,000. The Yukon Party also received $6,400 from Shoppers Drug Mart Pharmaprix, based in Toronto.</seg>
<seg id="50">As for the Yukon NDP, they received sizeable donations from unions: $10,000 from Toronto-based UNIFOR, $7,000 from the Ottawa-based Canadian Labour Congress and $5,000 from the United Steelworkers, based in Burnaby, B.C.</seg>
<seg id="51">In Nunavut, all those contributions would be illegal.</seg>
<seg id="52">(They would also be illegal at the federal level, because Elections Canada now imposes a $1,600 limit on all contributors to federal parties and candidates.)</seg>
<seg id="53">The Elections Nunavut rules, of course, apply only to individual non-partisan candidates contesting individual constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Nunavut Elections Act doesn’t regulate territorial political parties—because there aren’t any.</seg>
<seg id="55">But the Nunavut rules are clear: a $2,500 limit and no contributions from outside the territory.</seg>
<seg id="56">There’s another reality to consider.</seg>
<seg id="57">Yukon’s population, as of December 2018, stands at 40,700. About three in four of those people, 31,800, live in Whitehorse and its various neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="58">Almost all other communities are reachable by road.</seg>
<seg id="59">The only off-road, fly-in community is Old Crow, in the north of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="60">This means that when Liberal leader Sandy Silver or Yukon Party leader Darrell Pasloski did their campaign tours in 2016, all they had to do was jump into their SUVs and drive around.</seg>
<seg id="61">But if a political party’s election campaign in a comparatively low-cost jurisdiction like Yukon costs around $250,000, how much more would such a campaign cost in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="62">We don’t know enough to be able to offer a precise estimate.</seg>
<seg id="63">But given the well-known costs of scheduled and charter air service, it’s likely much, much higher.</seg>
<seg id="64">Elections Yukon reported that all territorial political parties in Yukon, together, received a total of $641,023.78 in revenues during the 2016 election year.</seg>
<seg id="65">So in higher-cost Nunavut, it’s conceivable that a viable three-party system could require between $1 million and $2 million in donations in any given election year.</seg>
<seg id="66">Given the crushing poverty that afflicts Nunavut, where about half the population is dependent on subsidized social housing and, for at least part of the year, income support, where will these political contributions come from?</seg>
<seg id="67">Party politics may not be as easy as you think.</seg>
<seg id="68">Without strict contribution and spending rules, a political party system in Nunavut could be extremely vulnerable to sleaze and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="69">No one, except those with vested interests, wants a system where big unions and big corporations, including royalty-rich Inuit corporations, could buy themselves an election.</seg>
<seg id="70">Incidentally, a poorly designed system for the Nunavut-wide direct election of a premier would likely create similar exposure to sleaze and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="71">In the end, it’s up to the elected representatives who run Nunavut’s public government who have to make the final decisions.</seg>
<seg id="72">But please be careful.</seg>
<seg id="73">As we said last month, look before you leap.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arctic airline merger could take 18 to 24 months to complete, CEO says</seg>
<seg id="2">“Integrating our two companies will require a tremendous amount of planning, coordination and hard work”</seg>
<seg id="3">The complex work of fusing First Air and Canadian North into a single pan-Arctic airline will take between 18 and 24 months, the new airline’s incoming CEO and president, Chris Avery, said on Wednesday, July 10, in a message to stakeholders.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="5">The complex work of fusing First Air and Canadian North into a single pan-Arctic airline will take between 18 and 24 months, the new airline’s incoming CEO and president, Chris Avery, says in a message to stakeholders.</seg>
<seg id="6">Transport Canada, following a decision by the federal cabinet, approved the merger last month, subject to a long list of terms and conditions aimed at protecting northern consumers from the monopoly that the merger will create.</seg>
<seg id="7">Avery’s message, issued on Wednesday, July 10, said the owner of First Air, Makivik Corp., and the owner of Canadian North, the Inuvialuit Development Corp., have completed the transaction that’s required to merge the two businesses.</seg>
<seg id="8">A phased approach</seg>
<seg id="9">That means they’re now ready to start the complicated tasks required to integrate their workforces, facilities, aircraft fleets, flight reservation systems, flight schedules and other parts of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Because of the complex nature of the airline industry and the many essential services we provide, integrating our two companies will require a tremendous amount of planning, coordination and hard work, to be completed within distinct phases,” the message said.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it could take up to two years before the merger partners will have unified their maintenance operations and consolidated their fleets to enable them to transition towards obtaining a single air operator certificate from the federal government, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Throughout that process, the merger partners will take a “communities first” approach in light of the vital role they play in northern Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">“We fully understand that our customers depend on us for every aspect of their lives and that in order to fulfill this crucial role, we must maintain safe and sustainable operations at all times.”</seg>
<seg id="14">Chris Avery, now the CEO and president of First Air, is the incoming CEO and president of the new merged airline that Makivik Corp. and the Inuvialuit Development Corp. are creating.</seg>
<seg id="15">Avery, who succeeded Brock Friesen as boss of First Air this past October, has been named incoming head of the merged airline.</seg>
<seg id="16">“As incoming president and CEO of the merged Canadian North, I look forward to leading our teams through this exciting transformation, incorporating the unique strengths and abilities of our dedicated and caring team members,” Avery said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnny Adams of Nunavik, currently the executive chairman of First Air, will serve as executive chairman of the merged airline, and Patrick Gruben, the current chairman of the Inuvialuit Development Corp. and chairman of Canadian North, will assume the role of vice-chairman.</seg>
<seg id="18">The statement confirmed that the new airline will be branded as Canadian North, but will continue to use First Air’s inuksuk-themed logo.</seg>
<seg id="19">No word on potential job losses</seg>
<seg id="20">The statement from First Air doesn’t say whether merging the two work forces will lead to job losses, and the airlines give no details on how they will merge facilities like hangars and cargo warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, the cabinet order setting out terms and conditions for the merger says any reduction in job numbers in the merged entity’s operations in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories should be achieved primarily through attrition.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the merged entity must create an Inuit training and development program “to increase Inuit representation across all parts of the merged entity’s operation and management,” the federal government said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Here’s how the merged airline’s aircraft will look.</seg>
<seg id="24">They’ll use Canadian North’s name and First Air’s inuksuk-themed logo and livery.</seg>
<seg id="25">For its part, the companies say they will continue to focus on recruiting Indigenous people.</seg>
<seg id="26">“Our goal will be to lead our industry as a top employer, with continued focus on recruiting Inuit and other Indigenous team members for excellent careers within the aviation sector,” their message said.</seg>
<seg id="27">And the two companies do say they’ll use a phased approach to merge the two airlines.</seg>
<seg id="28">That means that in the short term they will:</seg>
<seg id="29">• Continue to operate as two separate companies, serving customers as two separate brands.</seg>
<seg id="30">• Allow scheduled services customers to continue booking, flying and shipping cargo with either airline with no significant changes.</seg>
<seg id="31">• Allow charter clients, partners or vendors to continue working with the staff and departments they’re familiar with.</seg>
<seg id="32">For the longer term, the new airline will:</seg>
<seg id="33">• Develop a combined flight schedule to enable customers of both airlines to book any flight operated by Canadian North or First Air.</seg>
<seg id="34">• Work to expand Canadian North’s Aurora Rewards loyalty program to all scheduled flights operated by First Air, so that customers of both airlines have the ability to earn Aurora Rewards points and Aeroplan Miles that can be redeemed for free flights.</seg>
<seg id="35">And later this year and beyond, they will:</seg>
<seg id="36">• Roll out a unified “Canadian North” brand, featuring the First Air’s inuksuk logo on their livery, signage and other materials.</seg>
<seg id="37">• Merge the two workforces in a gradual process that will be done “hand-in-hand” with work on flight reservations systems, fare products, operational processes, fleets and facilities.</seg>
<seg id="38">• Do more diversification by expanding activities like their charter business.</seg>
<seg id="39">And their message repeats their oft-state rationale for the merger.</seg>
<seg id="40">“The highly inefficient status quo of two airlines operating overlapping flight schedules with aircraft capacity that far exceeds demand on most of our routes has contributed to higher airfares and cargo rates and impeded our ability to invest in improving our operations.”</seg>
<seg id="41">But the merged airline will operate more efficiently and serve everyone better, the message said.</seg>

<seg id="7">Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. marked Nunavut Day with a pledge to become an Inuktut-language workplace.</seg>
<seg id="8">NTI officials announced those plans at an event held in Kugluktuk on Wednesday, July 9.</seg>
<seg id="9">“One of the aspirations for Nunavut was for Inuktut to remain the majority language and its use in workplaces, schools and the public,” said NTI’s vice-president James Eetoolook in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="10">“We are leading by example and commit to being an Inuktut-first workplace.”</seg>
<seg id="11">To launch the process, the organization has sought the guidance of elders, NTI said.</seg>
<seg id="12">NTI said the territory’s education system is rooted too strongly in English and French and that has resulted in a decline in Inuktut.</seg>
<seg id="13">The organization also points to different articles of the United Nations’ Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which assert rights over self-determination and use of cultural practices.</seg>
<seg id="14">Language assessments have been completed with NTI’s staff, the organization said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Language proficiency varies across its four offices in Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, Cambridge Bay and Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="16">Already, NTI said its Inuit staff have received more than 200 hours in Inuktut training over the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="17">Next, employees will receive more focused training, based on their needs and their expertise.</seg>
<seg id="18">That will be delivered to three different groups, based on their language skills—a core group of fluent Inuktut speakers, non-fluent speakers and beginners.</seg>
<seg id="19">Language training will be offered by the Piruvik Centre, though NTI did not commit to any timeline.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Nunavut’s Inuit Language Protection Act, Inuktut is already defined as a language of work in its territorial institutions; in other words, Nunavummiut have protected rights to speak or write in Inuktut in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="21">A Statistics Canada study released in 2017 found that almost six in 10 workers in Nunavut (59.1 per cent) reported using Inuktut at work.</seg>
<seg id="22">The act also requires federal departments and the private sector to offer communications and services to the public in Inuktut.</seg>
<seg id="23">But NTI said Nunavut’s language legislation hasn’t always been effective.</seg>
<seg id="24">“We can no longer wait for governments to deliver on their promises,” said NTI president Aluki Kotierk.</seg>
<seg id="25">“We must take action.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Federal training scheme marginalizes southern Inuit, TI says</seg>
<seg id="2">StatCan estimates about 40 per cent of Inuit now live outside Inuit Nunangat</seg>
<seg id="3">A feast organized in Ottawa by Tungasuvvingat Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">Statistics Canada now estimates that about 40 per cent of the Inuit population in Canada lives outside Inuit Nunangat.</seg>
<seg id="5">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="6">A federal Indigenous training program that Carolyn Bennett, the minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, promoted in Iqaluit earlier this month “further marginalizes” the Inuit of Ontario, the head of Tungasuvvingat Inuit said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bennett “announced” the program this past July 8 at a pre-election photo-op in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="8">The program is called ISET, short for Indigenous Skills and Employment Training, and replaces an earlier scheme called “ASET.”</seg>
<seg id="9">The Inuit-specific component is worth $161.2 million over five years and $32.6 million a year thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bennett’s “announcement” in Iqaluit was actually an 18-month-old piece of news that re-hashed a commitment made in her Liberal government’s February 2018 budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">The federal government has named Tungasuvvingat Inuit as a delivery agent for Inuit training money in Ontario, along with six other agencies located in the various regions of Inuit Nunangat, such as the Iqaluit-based Kakivak Association.</seg>
<seg id="12">But TI says that although it’s a positive development, they’re receiving no new money in addition to what they’ve already been getting.</seg>
<seg id="13">And the federal government has not taken into account the explosive growth in the southern Inuit population, and the increased training needs that this creates, TI said.</seg>
<seg id="14">“Tungasuvvingat Inuit will not receive a single dollar of new money from this additional funding.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the population continues to leave Inuit Nunangat and relocate into the Ottawa and Ontario region, it is very clear that our current base funding is completely inadequate to support the current population of Ontario Inuit,” Jason LeBlanc, the executive director of TI, said in a release.</seg>
<seg id="16">To support this, TI cites the latest Inuit population estimates from Statistics Canada.</seg>
<seg id="17">StatCan’s latest data tables estimate 79,103 people in Canada report Inuit ancestry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of those, 31,860—roughly 40 per cent of the total—live outside Inuit Nunangat, StatCan estimates.</seg>
<seg id="19">“The fact that no additional monies will be allocated to TI means we cannot serve the community in Ottawa and Ontario that requires this much needed funding,” LeBlanc said</seg>
<seg id="20">After the program’s first five years are completed, Ottawa will contribute $32.6 million per year for Inuit-specific training.</seg>
<seg id="21">But TI said that’s not helpful to them, because the money is “locked in” for 10 years and as the Inuit population outside the Inuit homeland increases, there will be no new money to meet their job training needs.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Inuit living away from communities are already vulnerable and TI provides many of the services and programs they use in Ontario.</seg>
<seg id="23">The lack of direct funding will further marginalize the Inuit of Ontario,” the TI release said.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, LeBlanc said his organization is grateful for the partnerships that they’ve been able to establish with northern organizations like the Kakivak Association and the Kitikmeot Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="25">“Some of our partners in the North do see the value and need for continued investment in their beneficiaries living away from home,” LeBlanc said.</seg>

<seg id="1">A Pioneer Missionary’s Guide to Learning Inuktitut</seg>
<seg id="2">By Kenn Harper</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rev. Edmund James Peck.</seg>
<seg id="4">Known as “Uqammak,” or the one who speaks well, he opened in the first Anglican mission in the Baffin region.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Harper collection)</seg>
<seg id="6">In 1901, the Rev. Edmund James Peck was joined at his mission on Blacklead Island by a young Englishman, Edgar Greenshield.</seg>
<seg id="7">Under Peck’s tutelage, any new missionary’s first task was to learn the Inuktitut language.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Jan. 26, 1902, Peck explained in his journal the methods he used to assist Greenshield in his language learning efforts, and to continue his own learning, even though he had arrived at Blacklead already fluent after almost two decades of service in northern Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="9">“Good use is made of the native voice.</seg>
<seg id="10">We always have an Eskimo with us, and we vary our Eskimo teachers, for it by no means follows that if a person understands one Eskimo, he can understand all.”</seg>
<seg id="11">This is good advice.</seg>
<seg id="12">A corollary of this is that not all Inuit are equally good teachers.</seg>
<seg id="13">This explains the folly that happened within modern education systems in the Canadian Arctic during the last 30 or so years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when Inuktitut was not taught in any grades, many schools brought in local assistants or elders to teach Inuktitut a few times a week.</seg>
<seg id="15">An assumption was implicit in this, that, just because a person could speak Inuktitut, they could also teach it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Happily, sometimes that was the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">But, more often than not, it was not.</seg>
<seg id="18">Educators don’t do that in choosing English language teachers.</seg>
<seg id="19">Why should they do so when Inuktitut is the subject?</seg>
<seg id="20">In Peck’s time, there were no trained Inuktitut teachers.</seg>
<seg id="21">But some people had more innate teaching ability than others.</seg>
<seg id="22">And that was another reason for him varying his and Greenshield’s instructors.</seg>
<seg id="23">“The grammatical structure of language is attacked as follows:—In one lesson Mr. Greenshield learns a portion of the verb, and in another the adjective or noun.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adverbs of time, place, and interrogation are also committed to memory.</seg>
<seg id="25">This plan enables a student to construct sentences in a short time, and places him in a position to ask questions and get into actual contact with the people.”</seg>
<seg id="26">In this piece of advice, it is obvious that Peck thinks of the grammar of the Inuktitut language in the same terms as he does English, and describes it using the same categories.</seg>
<seg id="27">That works for some people.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lucky are those who can learn a language through simply hearing, then mimicking, and understanding without analyzing.</seg>
<seg id="29">But those learners are rare.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of us analyze, and we need some way to organize that analysis, mentally or on paper.</seg>
<seg id="31">I love grammar.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some people hate it.</seg>
<seg id="33">What I’ve quoted was Peck’s method.</seg>
<seg id="34">But today’s learners should do what works best for them.</seg>
<seg id="35">“Collection of words.</seg>
<seg id="36">These are, as far as possible, taken down from the lips of the Eskimo by Mr. Greenshield, and are finally revised before they are committed to memory.”</seg>
<seg id="37">Word lists are at the heart of language learning.</seg>
<seg id="38">Learn large amounts of vocabulary, and then manipulate the words, practising them within the context of the grammar that you are simultaneously learning.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unless you are blessed with a superhuman memory, you will need to write your word lists out so that you can practise them any time.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some people like to learn words thematically—family relationships, animals, land forms, emotions—there are any number of ways to categorize words.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others learn them randomly, but still write them all down.</seg>
<seg id="42">This is a good practice to follow, especially in the early stages of language learning.</seg>
<seg id="43">“Exercises in reading.</seg>
<seg id="44">We have one of the Natives who can read well to lead in this.”</seg>
<seg id="45">In my experience, there is a time for learning to read, but it is after considerable fluency has been developed in speaking.</seg>
<seg id="46">“We write down accurate accounts given to us by the people, or ask them to write out something relating to their mode of life, religion, etc.</seg>
<seg id="47">These we translate and arrange in a useful form.</seg>
<seg id="48">Several points are gained by this latter mode of study, the principal one being the correct idiom, which, I need hardly say, is an important matter.”</seg>
<seg id="49">Wouldn’t it be wonderful if these excerpts from individual life stories had been preserved in an archive somewhere?</seg>
<seg id="50">But it seems they have not been.</seg>
<seg id="51">They must have been extremely helpful to Peck and Greenshield in vocabulary building.</seg>
<seg id="52">Peck concluded his account of his method of helping Greenshield in learning Inuktitut with sage words, in which he recognized that one size does not fit all—that individuals learn in different ways: “Some of my missionary brethren may use different and better methods.”</seg>
<seg id="53">He noted also that the acquisition of Inuktitut, as with any language, required patient and persevering work.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reclaim Inuktut names, NTI encourages Nunavut hamlets</seg>
<seg id="2">“It has to come from the community”</seg>
<seg id="3">An intersection of road signs in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. is encouraging the territory’s English-language communities to switch back to their original Inuktut names, as one way to assert their Inuit language rights.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photo by Sarah Rogers)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Sarah Rogers</seg>
<seg id="7">What’s in an Inuktut name?</seg>
<seg id="8">The reclaiming of Inuit history and language, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. says.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Inuit birthright organization has encouraged 14 municipalities in the territory that still use English names to consider a switch to their original Inuktut names.</seg>
<seg id="10">“With 2019 being the International Year of Indigenous Languages, one of the things we’ve focused on is Inuktut-language rights,” said NTI president Aluki Kotierk, “and how to ensure that Inuit are able to receive essential public services in Inuktut.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“I thought this would also signal to Canada and even beyond that Inuit were reclaiming and asserting their language rights.”</seg>
<seg id="12">Many Nunavummiut already refer to their communities by their Inuktut names, Kotierk noted, but this is a way to make those traditional names official.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. sent out letters to 14 municipalities that still use their English names in March 2019, encouraging them to consider the change, and explaining the process.</seg>
<seg id="14">Under the territory’s Hamlet Act, a council can make a request for a name change to the minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are a number of examples of that happening, most recently in 2015, when Repulse Bay went through the process to re-name the municipality Naujaat.</seg>
<seg id="16">A handful of other communities did the same through the 1980s and 1990s, before Nunavut was created, including Iqaluit (formerly Frobisher Bay), Kugluktuk (Coppermine), Kimmirut (Lake Harbour), Qikiqtarjuaq (Broughton Island) and Kugaaruk (Pelly Bay.)</seg>
<seg id="17">Cape Dorset is one community considering the change.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Baffin municipality was named by a British captain after the fourth Earl of Dorset in the 1600s, but is commonly known by its Inuktut name, Kinngait.</seg>
<seg id="19">Some residents also refer to the community as Sikusilaq, after the nearby inlet that remains ice-free throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="20">Over the last few months, the hamlet council has launched a discussion with community members over radio and social media, to gauge interest in renaming the hamlet.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hamlet officials plan to include an informal ballot during the fall municipal elections, in which voters can indicate if they are for or against the name change.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kotierk said she’s also heard interest from Coral Harbour’s hamlet council, as well as Cambridge Bay, which is consulting local elders about a potential name change.</seg>
<seg id="23">“It has to come from the community,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The United Nations named 2019 as the International Year of Indigenous Languages, highlighting the need to preserve, revitalize and promote the use of the world’s estimated 7,000 Indigenous languages—2,680 of which are considered to be in danger.</seg>
<seg id="25">Kotierk said NTI has used the occasion to “make a lot of noise” about the urgent need to protect and promote the use of Inuktut in Nunavut, pressing both the territorial and federal governments to implement safeguards.</seg>
<seg id="26">In some cases, there are a number of different Inuktut names that are used in Nunavut communities; there is no official list of Inuktut names by which communities were once to referred to.</seg>
<seg id="27">Below is a list of Nunavut communities that still use English names, along with their common Inuktut names:</seg>

<seg id="1">At national gathering, Arctic Anglicans say no to same-sex marriage</seg>
<seg id="2">Church embraces reconciliation, Indigenous self-determination</seg>
<seg id="3">Anglican Bishop Joey Royal, director of the Arthur Turner Training School for ministers at St. Jude’s Cathedral in Iqaluit, speaks on July 12 at the Anglican Church of Canada’s 2019 synod in Vancouver, saying he opposes changing canon law to allow same-sex marriage.</seg>
<seg id="4">(Screen shot)</seg>
<seg id="5">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="6">Anglican bishops representing the Arctic and other Indigenous and northern regions played a crucial role earlier this month in blocking a resolution that would have amended the Anglican Church of Canada’s canon law to permit the solemnization of same-sex marriage.</seg>
<seg id="7">Anglican delegates from every corner of the country took part in a passionate debate on the issue this past July 12, during the church’s triennial synod, or national assembly, in Vancouver.</seg>
<seg id="8">The resolution would have replaced the words “man and woman” and “husband and wife” with “the parties to the marriage” and would have extended the marriage sacrament to all persons able to get married under civil law.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of many supporters of the resolution, lay reader Robert MacMillan of Nova Scotia, said he and his partner waited 20 years to get married.</seg>
<seg id="10">But to do that, they had to go to the United Church of Canada—because his local Anglican rector refused to marry them.</seg>
<seg id="11">“I don’t want your children and our fellow LGBTQ to have to wait and suffer and be considered second-class citizens, or worse, you’re not worthy to be a Christian,” MacMillan said.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the resolution failed on July 12, some of its stunned supporters cried out or broke into tears.</seg>
<seg id="13">Under the church’s rules, the resolution needed a two-thirds majority among each of three groups: lay persons, clergy and bishops.</seg>
<seg id="14">It won more than two-thirds support from lay people and clergy.</seg>
<seg id="15">But within the bishops’ group, 23 voted yes, 14 voted no and two abstained, a majority of only 62.2 per cent, if you do not include the abstentions, short of the required two-thirds.</seg>
<seg id="16">That means it likely failed by a margin of two votes.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Statistics Canada surveys, between 50 and 60 per cent of Nunavut’s population identify as Anglicans, making it the largest religious denomination in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="18">Arctic, Indigenous delegates say no</seg>
<seg id="19">Bishop David Parsons, head of the Anglican diocese of the Arctic, at the 2012 consecration of the rebuilt St. Jude’s Cathedral in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bishop David Parsons, head of the Anglican diocese of the Arctic, which includes Nunavut and Nunavik, was one of the bishops who voted no.</seg>
<seg id="21">“That’s our position.</seg>
<seg id="22">We are in line with the doctrines and teachings of our church throughout the centuries,” Parsons told Nunatsiaq News in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, Parsons said the Anglican church in the Arctic does not exclude anyone and treats everyone with “a love that is unconditional.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“We do not bar anybody. Everybody is welcome.</seg>
<seg id="25">That which we have experienced, we offer to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="26">That’s why in our mission statement we say we witness to all people regardless of race, colour, age, gender, or any other factor,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Parsons also set out the Arctic diocese position in detail last June, in an open letter.</seg>
<seg id="28">“I see in many Anglicans a loving passion for all, and a desire to eradicate the injustices people have inflicted upon one another.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also share this passion and I realize that the hatred, isolation and prejudices experienced by so many people because of how they identify themselves sexually is both tragic and heart breaking,” Parsons wrote.</seg>
<seg id="30">So although he feels sad to say it, “I must call the promotion, teaching, and endorsing of same-sex marriage false teaching and heresy,” he wrote in the letter.</seg>
<seg id="31">Joey Royal, a suffragan bishop in the Arctic diocese who is director of the revived version of the Arthur Turner Training School for ministers at St. Jude’s Cathedral in Iqaluit, said on the floor of the synod that his love extends to LGBT people in the church—but he can’t support the resolution and would vote against it.</seg>
<seg id="32">“This discussion is not about who is loved and who is accepted.</seg>
<seg id="33">Everybody is loved and accepted.</seg>
<seg id="34">Everyone is loved, everyone is accepted.</seg>
<seg id="35">It’s about the meaning of marriage,” Royal said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Royal was consecrated as a bishop this past March 31, along with Annie Ittoshat of Kuujjuarapik and Lucy Netser of Arviat.</seg>
<seg id="37">Rev. Caleb Sangoya, an Anglican priest and regional dean at St. Timothy’s church in Pond Inlet, also opposed the resolution, saying he fears that adoption of the same-sex marriage resolution could lead to declining membership in Arctic churches.</seg>
<seg id="38">“I’m looking after five parishes and they want to keep their tradition,” he said during the synod debate.</seg>
<seg id="39">At the same time, like other delegates who voted no, his words and body language expressed the emotional complexity of the issue, and he said he recognizes LGBTQ people who are “fully committed to Christianity.”</seg>
<seg id="40">“It’s hard.</seg>
<seg id="41">I love you all,” Sangoya said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Rev. Caleb Sangoya of Pond Inlet speaks July 12 at the Anglican Church of Canada’s national synod in Vancouver.  Anglicans embrace Indigenous self-determination</seg>
<seg id="43">Other Indigenous delegates also spoke out against the resolution</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, Lydia Mamakwa, bishop of Mishamikoweesh, read a statement from elders in her diocese, which covers 25 Cree and Ojibway communities in northwestern Ontario and northern Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="45">Created in 2014, the Indigenous Spiritual Ministry of Mishamikoweesh is the first self-determining Indigenous diocese within the Anglican Church of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="46">“We commit to follow what God has ordained marriage to be: one man, one woman, together in spiritual union,” Mamakwa said, quoting from the elders’ statement.</seg>
<seg id="47">“We strongly believe this alone is what marriage is.</seg>
<seg id="48">God has not changed marriage,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="49">“This has nothing to do with hating anyone.</seg>
<seg id="50">As brothers and sisters in Christ, we are the total of one another,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="51">Warnings against scapegoating Indigenous people</seg>
<seg id="52">However, the anger and grief generated by the same-sex marriage resolution’s defeat led two observers— in a recent article in the Anglican Journal—to warn their fellow Anglicans against scapegoating Indigenous people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Mark MacDonald, the Anglican Church of Canada’s new national Indigenous archbishop, said that attacking Indigenous people for their opposition to the same-sex marriage resolution represents “misjudgment and mischaracterizations of Indigenous people as a whole.”</seg>
<seg id="54">“We are concerned about the implications of that kind of scapegoating, and we’re trying to deal with it as gently and serenely as possible,” he’s quoted as saying.</seg>
<seg id="55">MacDonald is also quoted in the article as suggesting that those who express those kinds of hostile and negative opinions are less than consistent in their support for Indigenous self-determination.</seg>
<seg id="56">Another participant, Melanie Delva, the church’s “reconciliation animator,” is quoted by the Anglican Journal as saying that the vote on the marriage canon is a reconciliation issue.</seg>
<seg id="57">Self-determination, she says, “means that for some, abstention is the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="58">For some, a no vote is the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="59">For some, a yes vote is the right choice,” Delva said in the Anglican Journal article.</seg>
<seg id="60">In that spirit, delegates passed an “affirmation” that recognizes the right of Indigenous persons and communities to make their own decisions on same-sex marriage.</seg>
<seg id="61">“Whatever the action of the church at this general synod, we affirm the right of Indigenous persons and communities to spiritual self-determination in their discernment and decisions regarding same sex marriage,” the affirmation said.</seg>
<seg id="62">A vote on same-sex marriage narrowly passed at the Anglican Church of Canada’s 2016 national gathering.</seg>
<seg id="63">But under the rules of the church, a second reading was required in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="64">Many churches in southern urban centres like Ottawa and Toronto have been performing same-sex marriages since 2016, and the Diocese of Huron, which includes the cities of London and Windsor, will begin offering the marriage sacrament to same-sex couples.</seg>
<seg id="65">At the 2019 synod, Archbishop Fred Hiltz, the moderator of the church in Canada, apologized to Indigenous people for the cultural and spiritual harms that the church inflicted on Indigenous peoples in the past.</seg>
<seg id="66">And delegates also voted to create a national Indigenous ministry.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pond Inlet hotel renovations complicate final hearing on Mary River expansion</seg>
<seg id="2">NIRB staff may bunk down in Arctic Bay; others may stay at mine site</seg>
<seg id="3">This map shows where Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. plans to build railways to transport iron ore from its Mary River mine on northern Baffin Island.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">Renovation work at the Sauniq Inns North Hotel in Pond Inlet is creating a headache for the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s attempts to schedule a final public hearing on Baffinland Iron Mines Corp.’s expansion plans for its Mary River iron mine.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pond Inlet is the community that would be most affected if the Mary River expansion were allowed.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the hotel reno is making it difficult to figure out how to house all the hearing participants who would need accommodation in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="8">The review board had once hoped to hold the final hearing this fall in two parts: in Pond Inlet from Sept. 23 to Sept. 27 and in Iqaluit from Sept. 30 to Oct. 4.</seg>
<seg id="9">But earlier this month, Baffinland asked for more time to provide required information to north Baffin communities and to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="10">To make that happen, the company proposed a six-day hearing in Pond Inlet only, starting Nov. 4.</seg>
<seg id="11">Pond Inlet’s Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization, a major player in the environmental review process for the Mary River expansion, said it supports the delay that Baffinland proposed.</seg>
<seg id="12">But it also said it opposes holding the hearing in Pond Inlet only, since many intervenors may wish to use technical experts.</seg>
<seg id="13">“We agree that it is important to facilitate community participation, but believe hosting separate dates—one in Pond Inlet to focus on community input, and another in Iqaluit to focus on technical expertise—will be the best means to achieving this,” the HTO said in a letter to the review board.</seg>
<seg id="14">So NIRB now proposes a later hearing, split like this:</seg>
<seg id="15">• Technical presentation, Iqaluit Cadet Hall: Nov. 2-4</seg>
<seg id="16">• Community roundtable, Iqaluit Cadet Hall: Nov. 5-6</seg>
<seg id="17">• Public hearing, Pond Inlet Community Hall: Nov. 8-9</seg>
<seg id="18">As for accommodations for the two days in Pond Inlet, NIRB staff and board members will stay overnight in Arctic Bay.</seg>
<seg id="19">All other Pond Inlet hearing participants will stay at the Mary River mine site.</seg>
<seg id="20">As for the Nunavut Water Board, which is working with the NIRB on co-ordinating the environmental assessment, it’ll look at a technical meeting of its own in November and a possible hearing in February.</seg>
<seg id="21">“The NIRB will work with Baffinland to finalize details for participants regarding accommodations and transport from the Mary River Mine Site to Pond Inlet each day November 8 and 9 to attend the public hearing proceedings,” the review board’s executive director, Ryan Barry, and the Nunavut Water Board’s acting executive director, Karén Kharatyan, said in a letter.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new proposed scheduled would still allow the NIRB to submit a final report to the federal government by Dec. 24, the review board said.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the new schedule isn’t final yet—the NIRB and the NWB are now waiting to hear from the federal government on whether Ottawa will pay the cost of the proposed new hearing schedule.</seg>
<seg id="24">“While the necessary hotel and meeting spaces have been reserved, funding approvals from Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) for the amended process must still be obtained by the NIRB and will be requested as soon as possible,” the NIRB-NWB letter said.</seg>
<seg id="25">In its phase-two proposal, Baffinland wants to build a 110-kilometre railway between Milne Inlet and Mary River, double its ore production to 12 million tonnes a year and extend the length of its shipping season to July 1–Nov. 15 to accommodate about 175 transits of big ore-carrying ships.</seg>
<seg id="26">The railway to the north of Mary River would likely use a fleet of five locomotives and 200 cars.</seg>
<seg id="27">Building it would require multiple quarries and at least 12.7 million cubic metres of rock fill.</seg>
<seg id="28">The company already has a project certificate, received in 2012, allowing a railway running south to a port at Steensby Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="29">That means that in time, Baffinland’s iron ore production from Mary River could one day reach 30 million tonnes a year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut MP Hunter Tootoo to call it quits this fall</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Liberal MP says he’s leaving public life</seg>
<seg id="3">Independent Nunavut MP Hunter Tootoo at a news conference in Iqaluit in July 2016, held after he returned from a treatment centre in Ontario.</seg>
<seg id="4">He announced today he won’t seek re-election to the House of Commons this fall.</seg>
<seg id="5">By Emma Tranter</seg>
<seg id="6">Nunavut’s Independent MP, Hunter Tootoo, will not run in the Oct. 21 federal election and will leave public life, his office announced in a statement Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">“I appreciate very much the encouragement and support I have received from Nunavummiut all across the territory over the past months.</seg>
<seg id="8">But after much consideration, I have made the decision to leave public life,” Tootoo said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">First elected to the House of Commons in Oct. 19, 2015 as a Liberal, Tootoo was appointed minister of fisheries and oceans by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</seg>
<seg id="10">He held that position until May 2016, when he resigned, saying that he was leaving to seek treatment for alcohol addiction.</seg>
<seg id="11">He returned to his job in July 2016, but departed the Liberal caucus to sit as an Independent.</seg>
<seg id="12">Following his departure from the Liberals, Tootoo admitted to what he called a “consensual but inappropriate” relationship with a junior female staffer.</seg>
<seg id="13">That prompted some Nunavut residents to call for Tootoo’s resignation.</seg>
<seg id="14">But he stayed on.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tootoo also represented Iqaluit Centre as a member of Nunavut’s legislative assembly from 1993 to 2013.</seg>
<seg id="16">In his statement, Tootoo thanked his family, friends and parliamentary colleagues who helped him through “a difficult period in my life.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“With their support I have grown and healed, and I believe I am a better person for it.</seg>
<seg id="18">I encourage anyone who suffers from addiction, mental illness, or trauma to seek the help they need to heal,” his statement said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tootoo also praised Nunavut’s consensus government system, an experience that allowed him to work with “members of all stripes” during his time in Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="20">“To all Nunavummiut, I think you know how much I love our territory.</seg>
<seg id="21">My commitment to Nunavut will never waver.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wherever the next path in my life leads, I will continue to work for a sustainable economy that will secure a prosperous future for Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="23">Leona Aglukkaq, the former Conservative MP, has already declared that she will contest the Nunavut seat for her party this Oct. 21.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Elections Canada nomination contest database says that Peter Scholz of Arviat was chosen as the People’s Party of Canada candidate for Nunavut in a nomination contest held this past June 6, but the PPC website now says “announcement pending employer approval.”</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Scholz, in an email to Nunatsiaq News said, “I am not and have never been declared a candidate.”</seg>
<seg id="26">As of the morning of July 31, he had not explained why Elections Canada still lists him as a nominated candidate for Nunavut.  Megan Pizzo Lyall, a former Iqaluit city councillor who works for Atuqtuarvik Corp. in Rankin Inlet, has announced that she’ll seek the Liberal nomination in Nunavut, but the party has yet to announced a nomination meeting in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Nunavut New Democratic Party electoral district association has not yet announced a candidate.</seg>

<seg id="2">Michael Irngaut of Igloolik shot a caribou in 2015 while a hunting ban was in effect</seg>
<seg id="3">The Government of Nunavut is appealing Chief Justice Neil Sharkey’s decision to stay two charges against an Igloolik man for hunting caribou while a hunting ban was in effect.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Thomas Rohner  Special to Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">The Government of Nunavut says that the territory’s chief justice “erred” when he let an Igloolik hunter off the hook for illegally harvesting a caribou during the 2015 Baffin Island caribou ban.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hunter should still face the two charges under the Wildlife Act that Chief Justice Neil Sharkey stayed, the government said in court documents filed in at the Nunavut Court of Appeal in April.</seg>
<seg id="7">Michael Irngaut, a 22-year-old Canadian Ranger at the time, admitted to shooting a male caribou in February 2015 while on patrol.</seg>
<seg id="8">A government ban on hunting Baffin Island caribou came into effect January 1, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">Irngaut was charged with two offences under Nunavut’s Wildlife Act.</seg>
<seg id="10">But Irngaut, who shared the harvested caribou with other Rangers, told Sharkey that he never would have shot the caribou if he had known there was a ban.</seg>
<seg id="11">Before harvesting the animal, Irngaut asked a local elder and member of the hunter and trappers association for permission to hunt the animal, Sharkey heard.</seg>
<seg id="12">That elder told Irngaut there was no ban in effect.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sharkey stayed the charges against Irngaut in a decision released earlier this year in March.</seg>
<seg id="14">In that decision Sharkey said the unusual circumstances in the case, including geographical isolation and false information from an elder in authority, led to “officially induced error.”</seg>
<seg id="15">But the Government of Nunavut disagreed.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a notice of appeal filed with the courts April 5, the government said Sharkey was wrong to conclude such an error had been made.</seg>
<seg id="17">“The court erred in finding that the … contravention of the harvesting ban was the result of officially induced error,” wrote the GN’s lawyer, Adrienne Silk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Silk was not in court July 24 when the case came up for discussion before Justice Paul Bychok, who presided over the Court of Appeal’s speak-to list.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bychok adjourned the matter in the Court of Appeal until Nov. 13.</seg>
<seg id="20">Before then, the court would contact Silk “to find out why she was absent today.”</seg>
<seg id="21">Irngaut’s lawyer, Benson Cowan, said he expects the government to file more documents in the coming weeks to support this appeal.</seg>
<seg id="22">“This is a summary conviction appeal,” Cowan told Bychok.</seg>
<seg id="23">Summary convictions are considered lesser charges than indictable convictions, for example for violent crimes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those charged with summary offences have their cases heard before a judge only, and do not have the right to a jury trial.</seg>

<seg id="2">“Finally, Inuit have the tools to do the important work”</seg>
<seg id="3">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was in Iqaluit on Thursday, Aug. 1, to announce the first step in the creation of a long-term protected area in Canada’s High Arctic Basin—the new Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area.</seg>

<seg id="7">The federal government has announced a new conservation area off the northwest coast of Nunavut’s Ellesmere Island.</seg>
<seg id="8">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau travelled to Iqaluit on Thursday, Aug. 1, to announce the creation of Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tuvaijuittuq, which in English means “the place where the ice never melts,” is also known the “last-ice area,” as it’s expected to retain year-round sea ice until 2050.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trudeau’s visit also marked the completion of the Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area through an Inuit impact and benefit agreement signed on Thursday morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">Together, these areas cover more than 427,000 square kilometres, which means Ottawa has now met its goal to protect 10 per cent of Canada’s marine areas by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">The protection status prevents any new activity in those areas for up to five years, through Inuit can still harvest from either region.</seg>
<seg id="13">“By protecting these vital areas, we are safeguarding our environment for future generations while advancing Inuit self-determination and preserving Inuit cultural practices, languages, and customs,” Trudeau said at the Aug. 1 press conference, held at Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="14">The prime minister’s visit also comes with news of funding related to those protected areas: $190 million over seven years to build harbours, food-processing facilities and a training centre in the five closest communities: Grise Fiord, Resolute Bay, Arctic Bay, Pond Inlet and Clyde River.</seg>
<seg id="15">The IIBA for both protected areas aims to promote Inuit stewardship, providing an additional $55 million for Inuit training and employment.</seg>
<seg id="16">“Finally, Inuit have the tools to do the important work of being the eyes and the ears of [these areas],” said Qikiqtani Inuit Association president P.J. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="17">Akeeagok presented the prime minister with a marble carving of an Inuk hunter holding a harpoon over a narwhal, which he said should serve as a reminder of “the connection that Inuit have to this region.”</seg>
<seg id="18">Prime Minister Trudeau was headed on Thursday afternoon to Arctic Bay, the gateway to Tallurutiup Imanga, to visit Victor Bay and participate in a community feast.</seg>
<seg id="19">This evening, Trudeau will be back in Iqaluit to help announce the Nunavut Liberals’ federal candidate, Megan Pizzo-Lyall.</seg>
<seg id="20">During this visit to Nunavut, the prime minister has faced some criticism over the frequency of visits to the territory, compared to that of former prime minister Stephen Harper, who made a point of spending a week in the North each summer.</seg>
<seg id="21">But Trudeau urged Nunavummiut to look at the substance of the work his government has done in the North, especially through the Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee established in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">“There is a relationship now between the Crown and Inuit based on respect and partnership,” Trudeau told reporters on Thursday morning.</seg>
<seg id="23">The most recent evidence of that is the government’s apology for how it mismanaged the tuberculosis epidemic among Inuit between the 1940s and 1960s, along with a commitment to eradicate the disease from the North by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="24">But, Trudeau added, “there is an awful lot more to do.”</seg>

<seg id="2">“The working climate inevitably has a negative effect on the delivery of services”</seg>
<seg id="3">Some staff at the Inuulitsivik health centre in Puvirnituq have signed an open letter alleging that their working conditions are the cause of high levels of uncertainty, insecurity and anxiety among staff.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Jane George</seg>
<seg id="5">After a period of relative stability, things look rocky once again at the Inuulitsivik health and social services centre in Puvirnituq.</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past 18 months, there have been “serious and ongoing issues that staff are experiencing with the upper management” of Inuulitisivik, says an open letter circulated last month to officials and health board staff, and obtained by Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conditions have caused considerable distress to the employees, say the 14 signatories, who include employees at Inuulitsivik and the secretary-treasurer of the Northern Village of Puvirnituq, who signed in the letter in support.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the letter, they allege that Inuulitsivik has been “arbitrarily suspending and dismissing staff without due cause,” citing personal vendettas as the root of some of these actions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The suspensions and dismissals have caused high levels of uncertainty, insecurity and anxiety among the staff, they say.</seg>
<seg id="10">“The working environment across the health centre is toxic,” their letter states.</seg>
<seg id="11">“This is not a healthy situation for staff or users since the working climate inevitably has a negative effect on the delivery of services.”</seg>
<seg id="12">People of colour and Inuit are suffering the most, says the letter, which alleges a staff worker, who had been fired, had died by suicide.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nunatsiaq News asked the Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services for a response to the open letter on Monday, Aug. 6.</seg>
<seg id="14">An email from the communications department of the health board said “we will be in touch when someone becomes available.”</seg>
<seg id="15">It’s not the first time that Inuulitsivik has experienced turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 2007, Dr. Vania Jiminez, then Inuulitsivik’s director of professional services, compared Inuulitsivik’s condition to an abscess ready to burst: the director of nursing had quit, along with several nurses, and doctors were overwhelmed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Quebec was looking at a formal trusteeship for the troubled hospital.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 2006, cutbacks affected services at Inuulitsivik, which, before that, in 2005, had suffered huge payroll errors, an exodus of management, staff and board members, and serious work safety problems.</seg>
<seg id="19">By 2012, Inuulitsivik appeared to be in a healthier state: Quebec had written off the centre’s accumulated deficit of more than $100 million, and the centre, which includes a 25-bed hospital in Puvirnituq, managed to produce a surplus of more than $500,000 in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="20">Quebec also increased the health centre’s budget at that time by about $18 million to roughly $90 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="21">Inuulitsivik, which employs about 1,000 part-time and full-time workers on various rotations, also provides care to seven Hudson Bay communities and takes care of patient services for Nunavimmiut in Montreal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Environmental education gets federal boost in Nunavut</seg>
<seg id="2">Training program focuses on conservation and climate change</seg>
<seg id="3">Maatalii Okalik, then president of the Nunavut Inuit Youth Council, speaks with Catherine McKenna, the federal environment and climate change minister, on November 2017 in Marrakech, Morocco, where global talks on climate change were underway.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Elaine Anselmi</seg>
<seg id="5">A Nunavut training centre has a bit more money in its budget to train environmental champions in the workplace and in the community.</seg>
<seg id="6">On July 26, Catherine McKenna, the federal minister of environment and climate change, announced $200,000 will go towards the Ilinniapaa Skills Development Centre, and specifically to its project, Our People, Our Climate.</seg>
<seg id="7">“This project is looking at what else is happening in the circumpolar Arctic, seeing that yes, climate change is happening, and it is happening to us, but also, what could make a difference to us,” said Helen Roos, the centre’s president and lead instructor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through its Iqaluit training centre and online courses, ISDC hosts pre-employment training, such as resume writing and computer skills, and workplace training, like health and safety certification and mental health and wellness training for frontline workers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Though the centre has offered more technical programs in the environmental sector, like environmental monitoring for mine remediation and contamination, Our People, Our Climate is a different sort of program for Ilinniapaa.</seg>
<seg id="10">The project aims to educate Nunavummiut on climate change, with a focus on traditional knowledge and Inuit culture, as it supports healthy attitudes towards the environment.</seg>
<seg id="11">The idea is to look not only at how Inuit are being impacted by climate change, but also how they are impacting it, taking energy consumption and conservation into account.</seg>
<seg id="12">“Through the Government of Nunavut’s Department of Education, there is a curriculum around climate change,” Roos said.</seg>
<seg id="13">“But my company, we do training and development for youth and adults, particularly who might have dropped out of school, and we look to deliver customized training around issues affecting Inuit.”</seg>
<seg id="14">And climate change is, of course, one of those issues.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our People, Our Climate will include a sort of pre-employment training for participants between the ages of 15 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="16">The program offers five modules on climate change and environmental action, that will equip participants to work with some of the stakeholders in the project, including the territorial and federal government, different Inuit organizations and housing corporations, in environmental roles.</seg>
<seg id="17">The program is in English and Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="18">“They can become champions, really,” Roos said of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="19">“They’re leaders not just in helping to do in-house environment change but as advocates for the community.”</seg>
<seg id="20">The curriculum for this project is in the works, based on research from across the circumpolar Arctic and input from those organizations working with the centre, as well as Inuit leaders.</seg>
<seg id="21">“The funding is going towards research, stakeholder engagement, curriculum development,” said Roos.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Then testing it with multiple youth through the program.”</seg>
<seg id="23">She’s hoping to have that testing underway by November, and the youth doing outreach to their communities, or possibly co-op placements, by early next year.</seg>
<seg id="24">The federal dollars will be portioned out from the ministry’s Climate Action Fund, which supports projects fostering an awareness of climate change and working toward sustainable solutions for the environment.</seg>
<seg id="25">Roos noted that youth make up half of the territory’s population and will ultimately be the ones to carry forward an understanding of the risks of climate change, and the need to curb it.</seg>
<seg id="26">They will also be the ones most affected by it down the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">McKenna stated in the release, “I’m especially happy to know this program will reach students and young people.</seg>
<seg id="28">Across the country, young people are standing up, asking leaders to take climate action.</seg>
<seg id="29">It’s their future we’re fighting for.</seg>
<seg id="30">We are only borrowing the planet from them.”</seg>
<seg id="31">While youth are a focus of the program, it will work with people across the board to address areas where education is needed around the environment and conservation.</seg>

<seg id="1">As Trudeau confirms existing housing money, Nunavut’s premier makes the best of it</seg>
<seg id="2">“It’s the prime minister making the announcement and that’s a good thing”</seg>
<seg id="3">Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Iqaluit Mayor Madeleine Redfern make their way to an outdoor press conference in Iqaluit’s Happy Valley neighbourhood this past Aug. 2.</seg>

<seg id="5">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="6">Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq knows the territorial government’s not getting nearly enough money to meet its social housing construction needs, but with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau standing beside him this past Aug. 2, he was much too diplomatic to criticize the Government of Nunavut’s federal funders.</seg>
<seg id="7">Following the completion of deals signed on Aug. 1 to create the Tallurutiup Imanga protected marine area and the start of a new protected area called Tuvaijuittuq, Trudeau’s staff summoned reporters the next morning to an outdoor press conference held at a vacant lot in Happy Valley.</seg>
<seg id="8">There, Trudeau announced confirmation of how much social housing construction money will flow into Nunavut housing over the next eight years: $290 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">“We recognize that this is a big step forward that is going to make a huge difference,” Trudeau said.</seg>
<seg id="10">But those funds are made up mostly of previous commitments made in the federal government’s 2016 and 2017 budgets.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the money doesn’t come close to helping Nunavut get all the housing it needs.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Nunavut Housing Corp.’s latest numbers estimate a need of about 3,100 new units.</seg>
<seg id="13">That represents about 5,000 people, or 2,500 families, in Nunavut who are in need of adequate housing.</seg>
<seg id="14">“The funding will give us approximately 83 houses a year, so if you do the math you can see it will take us quite a while to get to 3,100.</seg>
<seg id="15">We’ll never get there,” Savikataaq said.</seg>
<seg id="16">That 83-houses-per-year estimate isn’t new. Savikataaq told APTN this past March that his government expects to build 83 housing units in the 2019-20 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="17">That’s down slightly from the 91 units the GN expected to build in 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="18">Though the numbers will likely vary a little from year to year, that’s what Nunavut can expect to build annually, between now and about 2026 and 2027.</seg>
<seg id="19">The bulk of Nunavut’s housing construction money was committed by the federal government in 2016—$76.7 million—and in 2017—$240 million, topped up by contributions from the GN.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nunavut received no funds for social housing construction in 2019, prompting George Hickes, the Nunavut finance minister, to say this last March: “The lack of Nunavut-specific measures is disappointing, and remains critical in successful nation-building.”</seg>
<seg id="21">But Savikataaq, this past Friday, said it’s still useful that Trudeau took the time to talk about Nunavut housing in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="22">“In my opinion, it means the federal government is giving us priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">It’s the prime minister making the announcement and that’s a good thing,” Savikataaq said.</seg>
<seg id="24">“It’s still a positive thing, because it brings it to the front and starts the conversation and lets everyone know about our desperate needs for housing in Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="25">As for homelessness, Savikataaq said that while the city government is “doing its part” in Iqaluit, there’s an obvious need for homeless shelters, transitional houses and emergency shelters in outlying communities.</seg>
<seg id="26">He said government officials have talked a lot about that, but he said the GN only has so much money and has to direct it to where it’s needed the most.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for Nunavut Inuit associations and corporations, which are now raking in cash in all three regions from mineral production royalties, Savikataaq said there have been ongoing talks about their getting involved in housing, but nothing concrete has happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">The 2019 Inuit Nunangat Housing Strategy, co-developed by the federal government and by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, said the Inuit organizations in Nunavut “are keen to help address the severe housing shortage in Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="29">But the plans the Nunavut Inuit orgs are looking at do not appear to be aimed at the kind of low-income people who generally live in subsidized public housing.</seg>
<seg id="30">Instead, the Inuit orgs of Nunavut are looking at affordable homeownership for Inuit who now live in government, business or private rental housing.</seg>
<seg id="31">“The program would also support and promote home ownership as a means of wealth generation and career creation that would further lessen the ﬁnancial burden on governments,” the strategy said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2016, 56.4 per cent of Inuit lived in overcrowded homes and 34.3 per cent lived in homes needing major repairs.</seg>
<seg id="33">And in 2017, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. reported that within the private market in Iqaluit, the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom housing unit was $2,597.</seg>

<seg id="6">By Kahlan Miron</seg>
<seg id="7">Canada’s minister of transport, Marc Garneau, announced new funding for multiple projects with a focus on Nunavut’s Arctic waters and coastal communities on Wednesday, August 14.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many of the funding announcements, which range from community infrastructure to environmental research, are related to the federal government’s Oceans Protection Plan—a $1.5-billion program focused on protecting Canada’s coastlines.</seg>
<seg id="9">Multiple Iqaluit-area projects received money: within the city, $2.3 million will go towards designing a hangar for a new National Aerial Surveillance Program complex, and nearby in Frobisher Bay, more than $430,000 will be split between two marine environmental data collection projects, one by the Government of Nunavut and one by SmartICE.</seg>
<seg id="10">The National Aerial Surveillance Program complex will include office space, an incident command post and briefing rooms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hangar, which will be built at the Iqaluit airport, will be designed over the next year by EVOQ Architecture.</seg>
<seg id="12">The hangar and facilities should be completed by 2023.</seg>
<seg id="13">The National Aerial Surveillance Program watches ships in Canadian waters to prevent pollution, using aerial surveillance to detect oil spills.</seg>
<seg id="14">The program also watches shipping activities, ice conditions and marine security.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, the environmental data projects in Frobisher Bay are part of the Coastal Environmental Baseline Program—a program meant to study areas with high or potentially high vessel traffic, connecting scientists with coastal and Indigenous communities.</seg>
<seg id="16">The program is part of the Oceans Protection Plan.</seg>
<seg id="17">Garneau announced the funds on behalf of Jonathan Wilkinson, the minister of fisheries, oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard.</seg>
<seg id="18">“What we want to do is to gather a baseline of what is the state of the coastal waters and its ecosystem at the moment,” said Garneau.</seg>
<seg id="19">The GN’s project will look at things like the density and biomass of renewable marine resources, like fish, and contamination levels in seaweed, while SmartICE’s project will, in collaboration with the Amaruq Hunters and Trappers Association, monitor sea ice near communities and collect environmental data.</seg>
<seg id="20">Outside Iqaluit, funds also went towards community engagement in the Oceans Protection Plan, with $300,000 each going to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="21">These funds come from the Indigenous and Local Communities Engagement and Partnership Program, which helps communities better participate in Oceans Protection Plan initiatives and the marine safety system.</seg>
<seg id="22">The QIA will use the money to fund engagement activities on Oceans Protection Plan initiatives, as well as ongoing participation in marine safety, while the NIRB will use its funds to participate in the marine safety system and improve the capacity of the Nunavut Marine Council.</seg>
<seg id="23">Garneau also announced that, under the Oceans Protection Plan, harbours will be built in Grise Fiord and Resolute Bay.</seg>
<seg id="24">Working with the QIA and the Government of Nunavut to design the harbours and fund construction, Transport Canada is providing $76.5 million over seven years towards the project, as part of a $190-million fund for infrastructure for communities in the Tallurutiup Imanga area.</seg>
<seg id="25">QIA President P.J. Akeeagok said that, in partnership with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, they have been conducting a feasibility study and hope the report will be ready before the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="26">The report should spark the next steps towards construction, said Akeeagok, which “Inuit in the communities have been waiting for many decades in terms of realizing that vision.”</seg>

<seg id="6">In a significant step toward Nunavut assuming control over its Crown lands and natural resources, representatives from the federal government, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. and the territory signed an agreement in principle for a devolution agreement this morning in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="7">The agreement was signed by Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. President Aluki Kotierk and Carolyn Bennett, the federal minister of Crown-Indigenous relations.</seg>
<seg id="8">“We know in Nunavut’s evolution, that this is a day of celebration, for Nunavummiut and a milestone for Canada…. It has been a long day coming and a long time coming,” Bennett said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The agreement begins a five-year process that would end in a final devolution agreement, which would transfer responsibilities for Nunavut’s land, water and resources from the Government of Canada to the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="10">“You are patient and persistent people … this unlocks the vision of self-determination, the vision of being able to look after your people and your lands and waters in a way that you know best,” Bennett said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Simon Awa, Nunavut’s chief negotiator of devolution, said the agreement marks the next step to devolution.</seg>
<seg id="12">“It marks the next step in the journey that started before the creation of our territory.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is a culmination of much work that began with formal negotiations between the Government of Canada, the Government of Nunavut and Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. in November 2014,” Awa said.</seg>
<seg id="14">“Devolution has been agreed for the Inuit of Nunavut, ensuring that decision-making power rests here in our territory, by us and for us.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“Today is a good day.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have to admit I wasn’t sure this day would come so quickly.</seg>
<seg id="17">It’s proof of how hard our devolution team has worked,” Savikataaq said.</seg>
<seg id="18">“By devolving federal responsibilities, Nunavummiut will have the ability and the means to manage their decisions on how our public lands, freshwater and non-renewable resources are used and developed within Nunavut,” he added.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kotierk said she was particularly pleased with Chapter 9 of the agreement, which will develop a post-devolution human resources and development strategy consistent with Article 23 of the Nunavut Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Article 23 of the Nunavut Agreement was meant to ensure employees at all three levels of government in Nunavut were reflective of the population of Inuit in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="21">“I hope that’s another push to the government to ensure that they actually live up to and implement Article 23, which Inuit have been expecting since Nunavut was created,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The newly signed agreement, which contains 14 chapters, is not legally enforceable, a news release said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The five-year timeline will allow for negotiation for a final agreement, training for positions within the GN, negotiation of an implementation schedule, and the drafting of legislation that will create the legal framework for the GN to take over the responsibility for Nunavut’s land, water and natural resources.</seg>
<seg id="24">Yukon has managed its own land and natural resources since 2003, and devolution in the Northwest Territories took effect in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="7">That’s part of more than $1 million earmarked for leadership development among girls and women in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a news release, in Nunavut, the money will be used to engage community, regional and territorial stakeholders in the creation of a Women and Girls Leadership and Governance Forum, and the piloting of related workshops.</seg>
<seg id="9">Elisapee Sheutiapik, Nunavut’s minister for family services and the status of women, welcomed the news.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Projects focusing on the development of women and girls’ leadership and governance are much needed across our northern territory,” Sheutiapik said.</seg>
<seg id="11">“I enthusiastically encourage women and girls of all ages to get involved, attain leadership skills, and engage with community, regional and territorial stakeholders.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no doubt that the outcome of these projects will benefit gender equality and grow leadership capacity within all Nunavut communities.”</seg>
<seg id="13">The Arnait Nipingita women’s leadership summit, in 2010, was an earlier attempt to collect, connect and create women’s voices in Nunavut, with the goal of advancing women’s leadership in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its recommendations include calls for:</seg>
<seg id="15">• More funding support for women’s groups in communities.</seg>
<seg id="16">• Adequate, accessible and affordable childcare resources available in communities.</seg>
<seg id="17">• Additional resources, such as midwives, to ensure that women don’t have to leave communities to give birth.</seg>
<seg id="18">• Increased municipal and territorial recognition of the importance of supporting women in leadership positions or leadership skill development.</seg>
<seg id="19">• Adequate counselling resources in communities.</seg>
<seg id="20">• Community workshops through Nunavut Arctic College or in partnership with other organizations and groups on specific leadership skills.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feds to clean up Nutrition North</seg>
<seg id="2">Northern-based committee to review program audits</seg>
<seg id="3">On August 21, the Government of Canada announced new items have been added to Nutrition North’s subsidy list, beyond perishable food items.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Elaine Anselmi</seg>
<seg id="5">The Government of Canada is working to clean up and shape up the Nutrition North Program with additional subsidies, more accountability and the roll-out of a harvesters support program, first promised last November, but beginning this winter.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mere hours before cutting the rope on the Canadian High Arctic Research Station in Cambridge Bay, Yvonne Jones, parliamentary secretary to the minister of intergovernmental and northern affairs and internal trade, was at the Luke Novoligak Community Hall on Wednesday, Aug. 21, to announce changes to the food subsidy program that has been steeped in controversy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most recently, research published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that food insecurity had actually worsened in Nunavut under Nutrition North, according to data from the Canadian Community Health Survey.</seg>
<seg id="8">A reason for this given by the researchers was that it targeted perishable store-bought foods only accessible to more affluent northerners—with or without a subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Cambridge Bay, Jones announced an additional subsidy of $1 per kilogram will be added to certain non-perishable products transported by sealift, barge or winter road.</seg>
<seg id="10">By targeting these cheapest methods for transporting goods, the hope is that subsidy will benefit the most vulnerable people, rather than those who can afford a costlier purchase.</seg>
<seg id="11">The list of eligible items includes macaroni, cooking oil, lard, baking powder, yeast, dry beans, lentils, beans and flour.</seg>
<seg id="12">As well, in an effort to address the health and well-being of women and girls in the North, feminine hygiene products will be subsidized at the program’s highest rate, year-round.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently, a box of tampons can cost between $15 and $20 in Iqaluit, compared to less than $10 in southern cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Harvester Support Program, which will put money in the hands of harvesters, will bring Nutrition North more in line with the needs of northerners in allowing better access to country food rather than encouraging reliance on store-bought food.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Throughout the public engagement process, Northerners most often expressed the need for further support for traditional harvesting,” said former NWT premier and Nutrition North Canada Advisory Board Chair Nellie Cournoyea in a release on the December announcement.</seg>
<seg id="16">“That is why we particularly welcome the Government’s commitment to introduce a Harvesters Support Grant to help lower the high costs associated with traditional hunting and harvesting activities.”</seg>
<seg id="17">Much of the controversy around Nutrition North, which in 2011 replaced the Food Mail Program, has centred around a lack of transparency and accountability for who exactly the subsidy was benefiting: the supplier and retailer, or the customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">One move to address this was requiring receipts from the point of sale to display the subsidy applied through Nutrition North.</seg>
<seg id="19">The announcement introduced a northern-based Compliance and Review Committee who will be appointed on the advice of the Inuit-Crown Working Group and the Indigenous Working Group, which include representatives of the four Inuit land claim organizations, as well as Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.</seg>
<seg id="20">The terms and conditions of the committee are still being worked on by the partners, but the committee will look over audits of the Nutrition North Program, have a hand in the review and help the government shape the program to better fit its mandate, that is, to play a part in addressing food insecurity in Canada’s remote and Indigenous communities.</seg>
<seg id="21">The additional subsidies are estimated to cost about $3 million over the program’s $14-million budget.</seg>

<seg id="1">Landmark settlement includes more than 40 day schools attended by Inuit</seg>
<seg id="2">Eligible Indigenous day school survivors can apply for payments ranging from $10,000 to $200,000</seg>
<seg id="3">Students at a federal day school in Cape Dorset in April 1964.</seg>
<seg id="4">Former students of 27 federal day schools in what is now Nunavut and 11 federal day schools in what is now Nunavik are eligible for compensation under a settlement agreement that was approved in Federal Court on Monday, Aug. 19.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Library and Archives Canada)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">Inuit who in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s attended any of a list of more than 40 federal government day schools are eligible for cash compensation under a $1.3-billion settlement agreement that the Federal Court of Canada approved on Aug. 19.</seg>
<seg id="8">The court’s decision settles a lawsuit, filed in 2009, that’s known as the “Indian Day School Class Action” or “Mclean Class Action for Federal Day Schools,” after the late Garry Leslie McLean, a federal day school survivor who launched the original statement of claim.</seg>
<seg id="9">The federal government and lawyers representing the plaintiffs reached a proposed settlement this past March.</seg>
<seg id="10">After hearings held in May, a Federal Court approved the settlement on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="11">The settlement compensates Indigenous people who—because they attended federal day schools—were left out of the $1.9-billion residential school settlement agreement reached in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the day school settlement, the federal government will put about $1.3 billion into a special corporation that will hold a fund from which compensation payments will be made to survivors.</seg>
<seg id="13">All survivors are eligible for individual compensation of $10,000 each.</seg>
<seg id="14">But for repeated sexual abuse or physical assault leading to long-term injury, individual survivors, depending on the degree of abuse, are eligible for payments ranging from $50,000 to $200,000.</seg>
<seg id="15">And the settlement will also create a $200-million legacy fund for commemoration projects, language and culture projects, and health and wellness programs.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawyers who handled the class action will get paid $55 million, and the settlement sets aside $7 million to help pay the legal costs of survivors who make claims.</seg>
<seg id="17">How to apply</seg>
<seg id="18">Survivors can start applying for compensation now, but payouts won’t start until 120 days after the Aug. 19 settlement date.</seg>
<seg id="19">To make a claim, you should go to the website indiandayschools.com, download a PDF of the claims form, fill it out and send it to Gowling WLG Canada, the law firm that is acting on behalf of class action members.</seg>
<seg id="20">Survivors will have two and a half years to make a claim.</seg>
<seg id="21">For more information, check out the FAQ section of the website.</seg>
<seg id="22">There, you can also find a complete list of eligible schools.</seg>
<seg id="23">Survivors may opt out</seg>
<seg id="24">Those survivors who aren’t happy with the settlement agreement and who wish to pursue their own lawsuits may decide to opt out of the deal within 90 days of the Aug. 19 settlement date.</seg>
<seg id="25">Survivors may do that by downloading an opt-out form here.</seg>
<seg id="26">You then fill it out, and send it by either email, fax or mail to Gowling WLG Canada.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those survivors who do opt out will get no compensation, but they’ll retain the right to file their own lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="28">“Opting out is a serious and permanent decision,” Gowling WLG says on its website.</seg>
<seg id="29">Inuit, Métis, First Nations all eligible</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite the use of the term “Indian day schools,” all Indigenous people—Inuit, Métis or First Nations—who attended one of the listed schools is eligible for compensation payments.</seg>
<seg id="31">“Using this word was not an easy choice, because we recognize that it has negative connotations for many people.</seg>
<seg id="32">Federal ‘Indian Day Schools’ were created under Canada’s ‘Indian Act,’ which applied to First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples,” the law firm handling the class action, Gowling WLG, said on their website.</seg>
<seg id="33">So of the more than 700 schools listed in the agreement, the number of schools likely attended by Inuit breaks down like this:</seg>
<seg id="34">• In what is now Nunavut: 27 federal day schools, including schools that operated in communities whose populations were relocated to other places, such as Port Burwell, Padloping Island, and South Camp on the Belcher Islands.</seg>
<seg id="35">They also include the Apex Hill and Sir Martin Frobisher federal day schools, and schools in multiple locations that over time evolved into today’s settled communities.</seg>
<seg id="36">But to be eligible, you must have attended one of those 27 schools prior to April 1, 1970, when responsibility for those schools was transferred to the Government of the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="37">• In what is now Nunavik: 11 federal day schools.</seg>
<seg id="38">Most are listed under old community names that aren’t used anymore, sometimes with eccentric spellings, such as Great Whale Federal Day School (Kuujjuarapik), Wakeham Bay Government School (Kangiqsujuaq), Notre-Dame d’Ivugivik School (Ivujivik) and Inocedjouac School (Inukjuak).</seg>
<seg id="39">In most cases, responsibility for these 11 Nunavik schools was transferred to the Kativik School Board on Sept. 1, 1978.</seg>
<seg id="40">• In what is now the Northwest Territories: at least four federal day schools, located in Tuktoyaktuk, Sachs Harbour, Holman Island and Inuvik.</seg>
<seg id="41">Responsibility for those schools was transferred to the GNWT on April 1, 1969.</seg>
<seg id="42">That means former students of schools such as Gordon Robertson Education Centre in Iqaluit, Sir John Franklin School in Yellowknife, the Keewatin Regional Education Centre in Rankin Inlet and the Churchill Vocational Centre in Churchill are not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="43">Inuit orgs critical of settlement</seg>
<seg id="44">In Nunavik, there are an estimated 3,000 former students from 11 different schools who may be eligible for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="45">Makivik Corp. says Nunavik Inuit with questions about eligibility can contact Makivik’s legal department at 418-522-2224, ext. 4.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., along with Makivik and the Inuvialuit Regional Corp., have criticized the settlement agreement because there is no Inuit representation on the fund that will manage compensation moneys.</seg>
<seg id="47">NTI has also been critical of the proposed settlement’s timelines.</seg>
<seg id="48">Last April, NTI, along with six other groups and plaintiffs, sought intervenor status in the case, but a Federal Court judge denied their application.</seg>
<seg id="49">If you’re feeling distressed and want to talk to someone, the class action law firm suggests you call the Hope for Wellness Helpline at 1-855-242-3310, which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</seg>

<seg id="2">Winners of $100M bonanza are Calm Air and Canadian North</seg>
<seg id="3">Under the terms of its new contract with the Government of Nunavut on medical and duty travel, as well as air cargo, Canadian North will service the Qikiqtaaluk and Ktikmeot regions and the Iqaluit-Ottawa route.</seg>

<seg id="6">Two airlines have walked away with the Government of Nunavut’s lucrative new agreement for medical and duty travel, as well as air freight: Calm Air International LP and Canadian North Inc., which is now merging with First Air.</seg>
<seg id="7">The GN announced the contract awards, worth at least $100 million in total, late on Friday, Aug. 23, a week before the current contracts are set to expire.</seg>
<seg id="8">The contracts carry an initial term of three years with two renewal options, for two years, and one year.</seg>
<seg id="9">“The total potential term of this contract is six (3+2+1=6) years,” the GN spelled out in its announcement of the award.</seg>
<seg id="10">After a request for proposals was sent out this last January, the GN received bids from Bradley Air Services Ltd. and First Air, Calm Air International, Canadian North Inc. and North Star Air, the GN said on Aug. 23.</seg>
<seg id="11">Under the terms of the contract, Calm Air will serve flights in and out of the Kivalliq region, including Rankin Inlet, Winnipeg and Sanikiluaq.</seg>
<seg id="12">Canadian North will service the Qikiqtaaluk and Kitikmeot regions, as well as the following routes: Iqaluit–Ottawa and Iqaluit-Rankin Inlet-Yellowknife-Edmonton.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since the RFP bids were received, Canadian North and First Air have moved ahead with a merger of the two airlines, which Transport Canada approved last June.</seg>
<seg id="14">The merged airline will be branded as Canadian North, but will use First Air’s inuksuk-based red and white livery.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Canadian North has been awarded a share of contract for the Qikiqtani and Kitikmeot regions based on a rigorous RFP process,” said a statement from First Air, sent to Nunatsiaq News on behalf of the merged airlines.</seg>
<seg id="16">“We are happy that we will be able to service this contract as a merged airline, leveraging the greater scale we can achieve to provide the best possible service to the GN and the communities in the Qikiqtani and Kitikmeot regions.”</seg>
<seg id="17">The contracts also include a public travel component, which requires the airlines to offer a percentage of seats to the general public at an economy-class fare.</seg>
<seg id="18">The new contracts come into effect in January 2020.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inuit stand with the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon: ICC</seg>
<seg id="2">“We recognize our critical part as Inuit, alongside our Indigenous brothers and sisters”</seg>
<seg id="3">“What happens in one part of the planet has impact on us all,” says Monica Ell-Kanayuk, the Inuit Circumpolar Council president for Canada, on Tuesday, Aug. 27, about the raging fires in South America’s Amazon region.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">The international circumpolar organization representing Inuit in Alaska, Canada, Chukotka and Greenland has sent a message of solidarity to Indigenous peoples living in the Amazon basin, and expressing concern for what the fires now burning in the region’s rainforests mean for the global climate system.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Transformation of the Arctic landscape, and of Inuit lives and livelihoods that are intricately tied to this landscape, will only be accelerated and further devastated by the raging forest fires in the Amazon that are raising global temperatures and fueling further melting of sea ice and glaciers,” the Inuit Circumpolar Council’s president for Canada, Monica Ell-Kanayuk, said on Tuesday, Aug. 27, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="7">“What happens in one part of the planet has impact on us all.”</seg>
<seg id="8">Inuit Nunangat homelands are already experiencing “catastrophic climate change,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 7.4-million-square-kilometre Amazon basin is home to one million Indigenous people, and about three million species of plants and animals, said the ICC, pointing out that the region is critical for regulating climate change, as its forests absorb millions of tonnes of climate-warming carbon emissions each year.</seg>
<seg id="10">But during rainforest fires, the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, and the rainforest’s ability to absorb carbon is diminished.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The massive impact on the planet’s carbon balance will have consequences for regions far from the Amazon, including the Arctic,” the ICC release said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ICC international chair, Dalee Sambo Dorough, said the ICC is “very concerned” about reports from Indigenous leaders in Brazil about the government of Jair Bolsonaro.</seg>
<seg id="13">“It’s unconscionable to hear that his government has unleashed an assault on Indigenous peoples by turning a blind eye, allowing farmers, ranchers, and miners to exploit deep into the Amazon rainforest—their homelands,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many are uncontacted tribes that have no firefighters, no means to put out these devastating fires.”</seg>
<seg id="15">Due to the fires, Amazonas, the largest state in Brazil, has declared a state of emergency. Venezuela, Bolivia, Columbia and Peru have also reported thousands of forest fires.</seg>
<seg id="16">“Countries which tout the importance of Indigenous rights have an obligation to press Brazil to change its current path,” Sambo Dorough said.</seg>
<seg id="17">“We applaud the French government for putting it on the agenda of the G7 Summit in Biarritz, and calling it an international crisis.”</seg>
<seg id="18">At the G7, the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States announced they would provide US$20 million to fight the fires, with France sending military assistance.</seg>
<seg id="19">Canada plans to send an additional C$15 million and water bombers, the ICC noted.</seg>
<seg id="20">The map above shows active fire detections in Brazil as observed by NASA satellites between Aug. 15 and Aug. 22.. The locations of the fires are shown in orange. Cities and towns appear white; forested areas appear black; and tropical savannas and woodland (known in Brazil as cerrado) appear grey.</seg>
<seg id="21">(Photo courtesy of NASA)</seg>
<seg id="22">The ICC also praised actions such as online petitions urging the European Union and the United Nations to put sanctions in place forcing the Brazilian government to address the problems related to deforestation.</seg>
<seg id="23">“We believe that other countries, including Canada, can also play a strong role,” said Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Canada has a duty to speak out.”</seg>
<seg id="25">With the UN Climate Action Summit now less than a month away and the annual UN Climate Change conference set for December, she said “there is no better time, indeed no more urgent time, to raise ambition and increase climate action internationally.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“We recognize our critical part as Inuit, alongside our Indigenous brothers and sisters, and we call on governments to support Indigenous peoples and to respond as an emergency like this requires.”</seg>
<seg id="27">Fires have also been burning in Alaska and Greenland over the summer, such as the one in Qeqqata, smouldering since early July.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut moves towards online health inspection reports, but legislation lags</seg>
<seg id="2">“It is time for Nunavut to meet national standards”</seg>
<seg id="3">Three of the four Quickstop locations in Iqaluit faced health inspection violations in 2017 and 2018.</seg>
<seg id="4">But those reports are not yet available to the public in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photo by Emma Tranter)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Sarah Rogers</seg>
<seg id="7">Pictured above is part of a handwritten report of a health inspection at the Royal Canadian Legion in Iqaluit from October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Government of Nunavut’s Department of Health is moving to an electronic system for filing food establishment inspection reports—one step towards making the reports accessible to the public.</seg>
<seg id="9">Health inspections are conducted at approximately 1,000 facilities across the territory each year, typically twice annually.</seg>
<seg id="10">Any facilities that prepare or sell food to the public are subject to those inspections, from restaurants to mine sites, to hospital cafeterias and school breakfast programs.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Nunavut remains the only jurisdiction in Canada that does not make its health inspection reports public.</seg>
<seg id="12">Adding to the challenge, the territory’s health inspectors have long prepared handwritten reports that have not followed any standardized ranking system, making it difficult to discern how critical health violations are or how to remedy them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier this year, health inspectors started filing reports using new software called Hedgehog.</seg>
<seg id="14">The program provides standardized compliance items for inspectors to check off and fill in notes, entered directly on a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="15">It also eliminates the challenge of deciphering handwriting.</seg>
<seg id="16">“It allows us to capture data which is something we haven’t been able to do before,” said Michele Leblanc-Harvard, an environmental health specialist at the GN’s Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Overall I think the tool will help us improve our program.”</seg>
<seg id="18">And here is a January 2019 report of a follow-up health inspection at the Legion, this time done with the GN’s new software, Hedgehog.</seg>
<seg id="19">“We’ve sort of dealt with a facility individually”</seg>
<seg id="20">The issue of closed access to food inspection reports was, in part, brought to light in a 2016 investigation by CBC, which through an access to information request found about a third of Nunavut’s food establishments faced at least one health violation between 2014 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nunatsiaq News found that percentage remains roughly the same in 2019, following a more recent access to information request for all of Nunavut’s food inspections from 2017 and 2018.</seg>
<seg id="22">The hundreds of reports Nunatsiaq News reviewed do not illustrate any non-compliance issues as serious as those facing the now-closed Baffin Deli, which included violations like cooks caught licking their fingers and coughing over food.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the reports show that Nunavut’s food establishments still struggle with basic sanitation, food storage, handwashing and structural issues.</seg>
<seg id="24">Take a July 2018 health inspection of a Quickstop store in Iqaluit, which revealed a number of infractions: broken floor tiles, protective covers missing from lighting fixtures and food products kept on the floor of the storeroom.</seg>
<seg id="25">“The conditions, many of which have been cited repeatedly in previous inspection reports over the last year, contravene the regulations and pose a potential public health risk and should be rectified as soon as possible,” read a letter from a GN health inspector to the store management, dated July 11, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="26">The issues flagged in the inspector’s report may not have been considered critical, but customers would have had no way of knowing that the Iqaluit store—and other Quickstop locations in the city—have repeatedly violated regulations under Nunavut’s Public Health Act.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even then, Leblanc-Harvard explained that facilities that violate Nunavut’s health regulations are not penalized.</seg>
<seg id="28">“Right now, we’ve sort of dealt with a facility individually, going over compliant and non-compliant items,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">“Then we move on to fix the high-risk, non-compliant items as quickly as we can.”</seg>
<seg id="30">Logistics in the North mean that there are often delays to fixing problems, typically due to waiting for resources to be shipped in to the community.</seg>
<seg id="31">“Structural things usually take longer,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Recent inspections at the Royal Canadian Legion’s kitchen in 2017 and 2018 provide a good example of that.</seg>
<seg id="33">A 2017 inspection flagged issues with the facility’s food storage and broken flooring.</seg>
<seg id="34">By the time inspectors returned in the summer of 2018 to inspect the Legion again, the floor had yet to be repaired; while a renovation had been planned, the materials had only just arrived by sealift and management was waiting for a contractor to arrive to start the work.</seg>
<seg id="35">Follow-up inspections or reviews are scheduled depending on the urgency of resolving the non-compliant item and the ability of inspectors—who are based in Iqaluit, Baker Lake, Rankin Inlet, Pangnirtung and Cambridge Bay—to reach a community.</seg>
<seg id="36">“We have to be a little more inventive with our approach, because we can’t fly into every community every two weeks to follow up,” Leblanc-Harvard said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Lingering issues with non-compliance would eventually go to Nunavut’s chief medical officer of health, she said, though she noted that it’s extremely rare to see a facility closed for violations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Inspectors could, however, recommend the municipality revoke a business licence.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Navigator Inn and Restaurant faced a number of infractions related to poor sanitation in both 2017 and 2018, when it applied to operate as a fast-food counter under a temporary permit.</seg>
<seg id="40">The facility finally closed for good last year, but Leblanc-Harvard could not confirm whether that closure was due to repeated health inspection violations.</seg>
<seg id="41">“We’ve gone in to recommend an operator shut down for a period of time to deal with non-compliant items,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">“But typically, we haven’t had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="43">Most people work pretty diligently to get an item fixed.”</seg>
<seg id="44">“It is time for Nunavut to meet national standards”</seg>
<seg id="45">Since the first reports of food facility violations hit Nunavut headlines in 2016, there has been a steady call for changes to the territory’s health inspection system, with a focus on making reports public.</seg>
<seg id="46">In more recent years, Iqaluit-Manirajak MLA Adam Lightstone has asked the Department of Health to commit to updating its Public Health Act, as well as creating an online, searchable database of inspection reports.</seg>
<seg id="47">“It is time for Nunavut to meet national standards and to ensure the safety and confidence of consumers,” Lightstone said.</seg>
<seg id="48">“I also believe that all establishments should publicly display the results of their most recent inspections, as is common practice in many other jurisdictions.”</seg>
<seg id="49">That’s the goal, said the GN’s Department of Health, though it’s not quite there.</seg>
<seg id="50">Nunavut’s new Public Health Act was indeed passed in 2016, but it requires new regulations to be in place before it can be enforced.</seg>
<seg id="51">Some of the regulations would allow food inspection reports to be made public.</seg>
<seg id="52">“Development of the regulations is ongoing,” the department said in an Aug. 15 email to Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="53">“Once they are complete, a cabinet submission will take place before the act is enforced.”</seg>
<seg id="54">The GN did not indicate its timeline for submitting those regulations, however, nor has a draft of those regulations been made public.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last spring, Nunavut’s Health Minister George Hickes told the legislature that the department needed more time.</seg>
<seg id="56">“It’s a work in progress,” he said during a February 2019 review of the department’s budget.</seg>
<seg id="57">“[It’s] making sure that the inspections are done and reported in a consistent fashion…. The software is going to help.”</seg>
<seg id="58">Once Nunavut begins posting the results of its health inspections, Lightstone hopes both the public and private sector will pitch in by consolidating report results through online applications.</seg>
<seg id="59">An app called Tomati, for example, provides public data on health inspection reports and assigns restaurants a score, all searchable through your smartphone.  The document embedded below is an example of the GN’s new, standardized health inspection reports.</seg>

<seg id="6">The last $21 million required to build the new Isuarsivik Regional Recovery Centre in Kuujjuaq has now been secured.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Aug. 29 announcement came from Yvonne Jones, parliamentary secretary to the minister of intergovernmental and northern affairs and internal trade, using a groundbreaking ceremony for the facility on Nuvuuk Bay beside the Koksoak River as a backdrop.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new funding is through Infrastructure Canada, in addition to the $6-million contribution by federal Indigenous Services last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other funding has come from Isuarsivik’s own fundraising efforts, as well as the Government of Quebec, Makivik Corp. and the Kativik Regional Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a grassroots organization, locking down the full $40.5 million to build the new centre was a tall order, and they’ve got big plans for those dollars.</seg>
<seg id="11">“We’re a small community-based organization run by a bunch of volunteers, so we are extremely excited about it,” said president and chairman Dave Forrest.</seg>
<seg id="12">“We’re ready to go.”</seg>
<seg id="13">Isuarsivik has been operating in Kuujjuaq since 1994, offering addictions recovery programming for people across Nunavik.</seg>
<seg id="14">“In our 25-year history, the first 15-to-16 years, we were essentially a 12-step model over 28 days,” says Forrest.</seg>
<seg id="15">The centre shut down briefly, just over a decade ago, with its team taking the time off to develop a program for Inuit, designed by Inuit, that focused on trauma and its relationship to substance abuse.</seg>
<seg id="16">That program, which was added to the original 12-step program, has now grown, particularly the centre’s focus on trauma, and connecting its clients with their culture and the land.</seg>
<seg id="17">In its current facility, Isuarsivik hosts nine people at a time for six-week sessions and two days of each week are spent out on the land, says Isuarsivik’s executive manager, Alicia Aragutak.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moving forward, Aragutak says the program will expand to eight weeks, three of which will be spent on the land.</seg>

<seg id="20">It will also include follow-up with people who have gone through the program and, eventually, Aragutak says, they’d like to have representatives in each community working for Isuarsivik to provide this aftercare.</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as hosting the new program, the new building will allow for a higher intake and for women’s and men’s programs to run concurrently, in separate spaces.</seg>
<seg id="22">Last year, the centre had to turn down more than 50 applicants due to lack of space, says Aragutak.</seg>
<seg id="23">“We expect it to be a bit bigger when we see numbers this year,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="24">“And this is not us reaching out and promoting our program, this is individuals that seek it for themselves.”</seg>
<seg id="25">The new facility will grow their capacity to 22 guests at a time, as well as offering space for families—including housing, daycare and a classroom, says Mary Aitchison, Isuarsivik’s vice-president</seg>
<seg id="26">“Clients and guests have indicated almost each time they do their evaluation or make comments in general, that they would like an opportunity for their family,” says Aitchison.</seg>
<seg id="27">This approach, focusing on the entire family unit rather than just the individual, will be unique among recovery centres in Quebec, Forrest added.</seg>
<seg id="28">Yet it’s something Aitchison has heard a call for many times in her years working in the education system.</seg>
<seg id="29">“Youth have expressed if you really want to help me, help my parents,” says Aitchison.</seg>
<seg id="30">“This is an opportunity for us Inuit to work on a program that we feel is based on our needs.</seg>
<seg id="31">Often, historically, we feel we’ve had programs brought in from the outside.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is an opportunity where we can develop from the grassroots, where we feel there is the need.”</seg>
<seg id="33">The new program will be reviewed by Isuarsivik’s board in October, and may be implemented before the new facility opens, though road construction to the new centre’s site is underway, as well as construction of fourplexes for staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="34">All of this was celebrated with an afternoon of throat-singing performances and speeches, acknowledging those who have made the project possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">“Since the beginning, in the past 25 years, there’s been a lot of volunteers and time put into Isuarsivik,” says Aragutak.</seg>
<seg id="36">“It’s definitely a perfect definition of a community initiative.”</seg>
<seg id="37">The majority of the centre’s operating budget will come from the Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services, though it remains a community-based organization, outside the larger health network, says Forrest.</seg>
<seg id="38">And there is still a lot of fundraising to do to keep growing the centre to support Nunavimmiut and develop programs that fit their needs.</seg>
<seg id="39">“We sort of look at this as a starting point,” says Forrest.</seg>
<seg id="40">“We see other avenues to expand: to build a house beside the centre, for elders, and we want to develop the camp out of town … we’re still hustling and we’re getting good at it.”</seg>
