<seg id="1">Eemeli Kouki led Hurrikaanit to home victory in the first game of the season - Savo Volley won the second time</seg>
<seg id="2">Hurrikaani-Loimaa, the team that has won a medal in the Finland Volleyball League for as many as seven consecutive time, began the season 2018-19 with a home victory, when they beat Loimu Raisio 3-0 on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Universal player Eemeli Kouki, who has returned to Finland from Romania, was the most effective Hurrikaani player with a total of 22 points.</seg>
<seg id="4">I had some potential possibilities abroad, but they never materialised, and then I got a phone call from Loimaa.</seg>
<seg id="5">We reached a pretty quick agreement, Kouki said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Toni Rumpunen, who, like Kouki, also has played for Loimu, supported Kouki with 18 points.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most effective player of the visiting team with 17 points was national team spiker Samuli Kaislasalo, whose deal with Loimu is for one match at a time.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is always important to win the opening match.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many players had experience from the opposing side, too, and that brought some extra to the match.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our game is not ready yet, but our goal is naturally to continue winning medals, Kouki said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Määttänen the best in Savo Volley</seg>
<seg id="12">Savo Volley’s Miro Määttänen was the team’s best player with 18 points, when the team beat Vantaa Ducks 3-0 at Vieremä.</seg>
<seg id="13">Our game was unpredictable especially when on the offensive, but luckily we managed to scrape a victory for us.</seg>
<seg id="14">I for one didn't have any conscious energy differences when playing against my old team, Määttänen said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Antti Siltala, who began his career in Vieremän Lentopallo regional series in 2000-01, made 12 points.</seg>
<seg id="16">Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was happy with many things.</seg>
<seg id="17">The hall was small, which means the atmosphere was excellent the whole time.</seg>
<seg id="18">I've a nice feeling after the opening match at home.</seg>
<seg id="19">Miro was a king, and Silli played a good game, too, Tuovinen said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Siltala’s previous League season was 2006-07, when he won silver at Pielaveden Sampo with Tuovinen as head coach then, too.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thiago Maciel was the Ducks’ most effective player with 14 points.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mikkonen again the star of Akaa-Volley</seg>
<seg id="23">Joni Mikkonen,the best scorer in the League during 2012-13, has had a strong start this season, too.</seg>
<seg id="24">The spiker made 25 points when Akaa-Volley had their first win of the season after beating Kokkolan Tiikerit 3-2.</seg>
<seg id="25">My season has had a pretty good start.</seg>
<seg id="26">Today a loss was close, though, since we were losing the fourth set 17-21.</seg>
<seg id="27">Somewhere we managed to find a set won, and a fifth set at the same time, said Mikkonen.</seg>
<seg id="28">The best scorer of Tiikerit, a team that was in the final some seasons ago, was spiker Edvarts Buivids with 28 points.</seg>
<seg id="29">Fellow countryman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported him with 17 points.</seg>
<seg id="30">We didn’t manage to get almost any hold of the opponent’s spiker, Mikkonen complimented.</seg>

<seg id="1">Attacks against abortion rights now in the United States - a strong documentary tells us why</seg>
<seg id="2">The US Senate is currently attempting to investigate, whether Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's nominee for one of the nine members of the Supreme Court can be chosen for the job.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many in the Republican party hope that with Kavanaugh's decisive vote, so-called Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal in the USA in 1973 could be reversed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's Reversing Roe documentary illustrates how the current situation has developed over the years.</seg>
<seg id="5">As unbelievable as it feels, the topic is timely also in Finland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (Blue Reform) has conducted pr work against safe abortion, and received different levels of support from the greater part of our country's Members of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the beginning of this strong documentary, we meet gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who is now, because of the law restrictions, the only Missouri state doctor providing abortions.</seg>
<seg id="8">An armed guard at the clinic says he is defending the freedom of religion in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">The news videos remind us about lethal terrorist attacks against the clinics.</seg>
<seg id="10">Let us move to the time abortion was illegal in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="11">At that time, an evangelical clergymen alliance directed women to reliable abortion doctors.</seg>
<seg id="12">The reasoning of the interviewed pastor is sound, but actually not really needed, a picture of a woman died of a self-made abortion is enough.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were about 5,000 deaths a year in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="14">The legalisation of abortions was defended especially by the Republican party.</seg>
<seg id="15">Already in 1967, California Governor Ronald Reagan signed the abortion rights act.</seg>
<seg id="16">Later it was precisely Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign who, in a revolutionary manner, began to mix religion with politics in order to draw voters.</seg>
<seg id="17">Another to go back on his stance on abortion was Reagan's follower - George Bush senior.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the same was done also by Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="19">The documentary reaches the very core of the matter when it looks for the founding reason for the politicisation of abortion.</seg>
<seg id="20">When religious organisation supporting racial segregation were refused tax exemption, they became politically active.</seg>
<seg id="21">Abortion was chosen as their rallying cry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Religion has brought exceptional knots to politics.</seg>
<seg id="23">While writing this, the situation in the United States is such that a president, who bragged about his sexual harassment but managed to win the votes of the religious Right with his stand on abortion, announced Kavanaugh as a nominee to the Supreme Court, who is now charged of sexual harassment by many women.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kavanaugh may hold the balance of power to decide about the rights of 164 million American women and girls.</seg>

<seg id="4">According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.</seg>

<seg id="1">Paedophile help service immediately filled up with reservations - in Finland about 40,000 are attracted to children</seg>
<seg id="2">It is estimated that about two per cent of men and a small part of women are at least somewhat attracted to pre-teens.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Finland this means about 40,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Those sexually attracted to children or young people have up to the present had a difficult time finding help.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Finnish Foundation for Supporting Ex-offenders and Sexpo foundation have a common SeriE project that educates professionals in meeting paedophiles as clients and helps people who are sexually attracted to children.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the project was published in the spring, it caused a real stream of emails to Sexpo, who offer counselling and therapy, and all the appointments were quickly reserved, Yle says.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is promised, however, that appointments will become available during the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sexual attraction towards children causes shame to many.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most of the people who have noticed paedophiliac feelings in themselves have not acted out their fantasies, thus committing no criminal acts.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the attraction is usually a permanent trait.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of these people hope to be rid of the thoughts that cause distress and depress them.</seg>
<seg id="12">They also make normal life more difficult, sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as an expert in the project, says to Yle.</seg>
<seg id="13">I think the work is valuable, if even one child can be saved from sexual violence, Thesleff says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Leaders of Koreas or a gynaecologist from Kongo?</seg>
<seg id="2">The President of the United States Donald Trump winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the thought may sound weird at first, but, according to the odds, Trump is one of the biggest favourites to receive the prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is due to Trump’s role in making North Korea commit itself to de-nuclearisation - at least in words.</seg>
<seg id="4">Based on the odds, the biggest favourites for Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met this year already three times and promised to try to achieve peace treaty between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">The thaw in relations between the Koreas is remarkable, because as recently as last year the relations were frosty.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even so, awarding a prize to Kim, who has for years threatened with nuclear weapons and who leads his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly cause criticism.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Nobel laureates are revealed starting Monday, and on Friday is the turn of the prize that attracts the most attention: the Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="8">If the Price is not awarded to participants of diplomacy on Korean peninsula, one of the top nominees is a Congolese doctor Denis Mukwage.</seg>
<seg id="9">In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Kongo, the esteemed gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who were victims of gang rapes, and he has become the world's leading expert on his field.</seg>
<seg id="10">With his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a terryifying by-product of many conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="11">Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered to be a strong candidate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nobel Committee has revealed that this year there are 331 nominees for the Prize.</seg>
<seg id="13">The names of the nominees are not made public.</seg>
<seg id="14">Trump himself would not mind receiving a Nobel.</seg>
<seg id="15">In May a reported asked him in White House, whether he feels he deserves a peace prize.</seg>
<seg id="16">Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump smiled.</seg>
<seg id="17">I want to get it finished.</seg>
<seg id="18">The prize I want is victory for the world, the president continued referring to North Korea negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are facts, however, that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Norwegian Nobel Committee who decide on the award, has often awarded the prize to people and organisations that represent liberal democracy and multipolar world order - exactly such international co-operation Trump has has been seen opposed to.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the 21st century three US politicians have received the Prize, all of them democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Awarding Trump would mean a complete ideological reversal for the Nobel Committee.</seg>

<seg id="1">A fire alarm in a tunnel: Motorists acted like behaved like lemmings, driving in the wrong direction</seg>
<seg id="2">A traffic chaos on national road 1 at Lohja took place on 8 September.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tunnel area traffic was halted because of the announcement to both Turku and Helsinki directions.</seg>
<seg id="4">When the reason was discovered to be a system error, fire service attempted to normalise the traffic.</seg>
<seg id="5">That did not happen very fast, though.</seg>
<seg id="6">We attempted to open the road once before, but Traffic Management Finland said it cannot be done, because there are motorists spread out on the road, driving any which way, fire officer on duty Pasi Kääriäinen told to STT back then.</seg>
<seg id="7">People were even driving the motorway in the wrong direction, after only a moment of waiting.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the first one acts contrary to traffic regulations, a few other often follow, Contact Manager for Finnish Road Safety Control, Tapio Heiskanen wonders.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to traffic regulations, stopping on a motorway or in tunnels is allowed only for a compelling reason.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finnish Road Safety Control notes that one cannot danger the traffic in exceptional situations with rash decisions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Emergency vehicles must always be given as unimpeded an access as possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is particularly forbidden to drive in an opposite direction on a motorway, just like making a U-turn or reversing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The same prohibition stands also in tunnels, where one must additionally always turn on the headlights.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, stopping without a compelling reason is forbidden, as is naturally parking.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some time ago there were even cases where the driver stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.</seg>
<seg id="16">It should be obvious that is a wrong time and place for such activity, Heiskanen says in a Finnish Road Safety Control announcement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ilves supporters would have wanted to continue their party even when the ship got stuck to the bottom of a lake</seg>
<seg id="2">Ilves fans carried by lake ship M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay aboard and continue their victory celebration, even when the ship’s bow was stuck to the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the event.</seg>
<seg id="3">M/S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted away from its route late Saturday evening, and its bow got stuck to the bottom of the lake in Akaa's Vanajavesi.</seg>
<seg id="4">19 passengers and five crew members aboard were evacuated to the mainland during the night.</seg>
<seg id="5">No one was hurt during the incident.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ilves supporters would have wanted to continue their celebration aboard until morning, but naturally it was more sensible to send them to the harbour with the fire brigade and then back home in a bus, Syrjä told STT.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which Ilves won 4-3.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to Syrjä, the Saturday accident was caused by the fact that water level at Vanajavesi was about 50 cm lower than usually.</seg>
<seg id="9">Syrjä said that the navigation was also complicated by the closest channel marking being covered by gull droppings, which meant its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn evening.</seg>
<seg id="10">No noteworthy crash</seg>
<seg id="11">Ship damage happened on the west side of Jumusensalmi shortly after the ship route had passed under the bridge between the Tampere-Helsinki motorway.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Syrjä, there was no bigger drama involved in the event, because the ship's speed was very low at the time of the event, and hitting the bottom did not cause any significant crash.</seg>
<seg id="13">Syrjä says getting stuck to the bottom did not cause any leaks or dents to the ship, and it looks like the cruises can continue normally.</seg>
<seg id="14">A diver checked the ship condition on Saturday morning, before the ship was towed from the shoal.</seg>
<seg id="15">Just to be on safe side, we are going to the dock to check this caused no damage, Syrjä says.</seg>
<seg id="16">Syrjä believes the next M/S Tampere cruise, booked for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.</seg>
<seg id="17">The ship's cruise season continues until the independence day, he says.</seg>
<seg id="18">No use for ambulances</seg>
<seg id="19">Rescue department received an alarm about the event on Saturday evening little after half pas eleven.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ambulances were sent to Viiala harbour to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="21">Fire master on duty Matti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult because of darkness and relatively high winds.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pirkanmaa rescue department reported on the night between Saturday and Sunday after half past two that all those aboard the ship had been evacuated and the passengers had been moved to Tampere by a bus.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cruise ship built in 1957 has been renovated in 2001, 2014, and 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's justice nominee accused of sexual assault and drinking may be left without the top position</seg>
<seg id="2">Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a Justice to the Supreme Court, may well be left without the position he is pursuing, estimates programme director Mika Aaltola from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="3">So far at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour in his student days.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Aaltola, the suspicions have created so much pressure on the Republican party that president Donald Trump may decide to nominate someone else for the position.</seg>
<seg id="5">Every now and then there have been cases in the United States that the president’s nominee for a Justice to the Supreme Court has caused plenty of disagreements.</seg>
<seg id="6">Usually in these cases the justice nominee has withdrawn themself, Aaltola says.</seg>
<seg id="7">This way the president has been able to save his face.</seg>
<seg id="8">The nomination would benefit the Democrats</seg>
<seg id="9">The Supreme Court of the United States attempts to stay above politics, but at least in the Kavanaugh case, the nomination of a new Justice has become an extremely sensitive process politically.</seg>
<seg id="10">If Kavanaugh is nominated, Aaltola says it will most likely benefit the Democrats in the coming Congress midterm elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would raise voting enthusiasm among young people and women, who are more likely to vote for Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, nominating a conservative Justice to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is no opportunity for a nomination every presidential term, because the United States Supreme Court justices are nominated for life.</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, some of them have retired at their own request around the age of 70 to 80.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even some Republicans hesitate about the nomination</seg>
<seg id="16">A background check is anyhow normally conducted of the nominees as Supreme Court justices, Aaltola states.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though Trump has set a time limit of only a week for the FBI’s further investigations, according to Aaltola it can still reveal something substantial.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yes, it can.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is rarely smoke without fire, Aaltola says.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to Aaltola, one thing that is certain is that Kavanaugh's suitability or unsuitability for the position will come up in many discussions before the Senate makes its decision.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Republicans have a Senate majority with 51 votes against 49, but at least two female Republican senators are suspected to have a doubtful attitude towards Kavanaugh nomination.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most embarrassing thing would be if the nomination would be voted on, and the Republicans lost.</seg>

<seg id="1">The elderly are defenceless in social welfare and health care reform</seg>
<seg id="2">Now we have a real example about what social welfare and health care reform's change limiter, outlined by Sipilä’s government, actually means in practice.</seg>
<seg id="3">My place of birth, Vaala municipality's social welfare and health care services are provided by Oulunkaari joint municipal authority. The health care manager of the joint authority is a former regional manager of Attendo, chosen in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leaders of the joint municipal authority warn the municipal council about the change limiter.</seg>
<seg id="5">If the social welfare and health care costs increase now, the municipality’s government subsidies will be cut in the future.</seg>
<seg id="6">The municipality’s Centre Party decision-makers had a fright, and most of them are ready for the great structural change of services for older people, which would end the institutional care at the health centre ward and the small unit for those with memory disorders.</seg>
<seg id="7">Home nursing would increase, which in Vaala, a place of great distances, means that the elderly living in outlying villages are uprooted and brought next to a health centre to be nursed “at home”.</seg>
<seg id="8">Attendo trusted the municipality to pay for its customers.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Vaala Left Alliance did not swallow the bad preparation, but organised a nice public event, attended by many family members, practical nurses, and also local councillors from other parties.</seg>
<seg id="10">Using social welfare and health care county preparation slides, I showed how Vaala municipality already has the biggest number of elderly people nursed at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.</seg>
<seg id="11">Carina Läntinen, a local councillor from a neighbouring municipality participated.</seg>
<seg id="12">A local newspaper wrote an extensive story about the event, and this in turn made Oulunkaari draughtspersons’ hackles rise.</seg>
<seg id="13">Social welfare and health care reform draughtspersons will not commit to writing that Attendo has built a new nursinghome to Vaala, and now it is empty, waiting for residents.</seg>
<seg id="14">There are no other service providers.</seg>

<seg id="4">A bit under three weeks ago Ferrari announced the Räikkönen will not continue with the team next season, and at the same time Räikkönen announced his move to Sauber.</seg>
<seg id="5">Naturally Hamilton doesn’t believe Räikkönen would throw in the towel.</seg>
<seg id="6">I don’t think Kimi is going to change in the last races.</seg>
<seg id="7">He is an extraordinary professional - a fantastic driver.</seg>

<seg id="2">The highest level of junior football ends on Saturday, when the last leg of the season is played.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before the leg beginning at 1 pm, the starting points for the title match were plain: FC Lahti Akatemia only needs one point against Vasa IFK to win the title.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the situation to turn around in the last leg, the second in the struggle for the title, Ilves, has to win PK-35 and hope for the Lahti team to lose.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lahti team’s title was however practically certain already before start whistle, since Vasa IFK came to Lahti with only seven players.</seg>
<seg id="6">If there were one player less from Vaasa, the match could not have begun.</seg>
<seg id="7">FC Lahti Akatemia won the match 16-0.</seg>
<seg id="8">At half-time, Lahti was leading 7-0.</seg>
<seg id="9">One reason for the Vaasa player loss is that the team has in part used the same players for the A-Junior League (P20 League) and men’s Kakkonen (tier 3) Group C.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Kakkonen, Vasa IFK has basically played the whole season against the threat of being relegated to tier 4.</seg>

<seg id="5">With the video, Williams supports Breast Cancer Network Australia.</seg>
<seg id="6">‘I’ve recorded a version of The Divinyls’ global hit “I Touch Myself” to remind women to self-check [breasts] regularly’, Williams writes in her Instagram message.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yes, this put me out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it’s an issue that affects all women of all colors, all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">Early detection is key - it saves so many lives.</seg>

<seg id="1">Should you go to work tomorrow if you have the sniffles?</seg>
<seg id="2">Here are the fact-based pros and cons</seg>
<seg id="3">The flu season is underway.</seg>
<seg id="4">Many are wondering whether to stay at home or not.</seg>
<seg id="5">The hard workers should however consider, whether it is worth it to infect others, because the illness can be contagious, even though their own symptoms were minor.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sometimes flu symptoms attack all of a sudden, sometimes they steal on you.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the latter situation you may already infect others, even though your own symptoms would feel minor, Prevention publication describes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should you stay home then?</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Prevention, before a person even experiences symptoms of the flu, they are contagious.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can pass the virus from about a day before the first symptoms up until about five to seven days after.</seg>
<seg id="11">Children with the flu may be contagious for longer than a week.</seg>
<seg id="12">As soon as you are aware of any symptoms, you should not be in school or at work.</seg>
<seg id="13">Return when you are no longer coughing and no longer have a fever, says medical professor Gregory Poland.</seg>
<seg id="14">You should also avoid exercise.</seg>
<seg id="15">Too quick a return to the gym can hamper the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="16">Also be sure to wash your hands and sneeze or cough into a tissue and throw away the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="17">Leaving home when ill?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you must leave the house while ill, consider using a face mask.</seg>
<seg id="19">The mask doesn’t filter out viruses, but it keeps the user aware of the head area.</seg>
<seg id="20">When you wear it, you can't put your finger in your nose or mouth, Poland says.</seg>
<seg id="21">Also sneezes are constrained with the mask.</seg>
<seg id="22">How can you prevent infection, then?</seg>
<seg id="23">The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is hard to avoid the latter, though.</seg>
<seg id="25">For example, the average American is putting their finger in their eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lake ship M/S Tampere ran aground at Pyhäjärvi, Akaa, late Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="3">The rescue department received an alarm about a water traffic accident on Friday evening little after half past eleven.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 30-metre M/S Tampere had ran aground, and its bow is firmly stuck in the rocks, described the fire master on duty, Matti Willman.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ship had 19 passengers and five crew members aboard.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the rescue department, there were no injuries.</seg>
<seg id="7">All the passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now they are being transported to Tampere in a bus, said the manager on duty, Jari Nieminen, to STT after one o’clock in the night.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ambulances were sent to Viiala harbour to receive evacuated passengers.</seg>
<seg id="10">For some reason, the ship, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, had drifted away from its route on the west side of narrow Jumusensalmi.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police investigates the reason for the accident.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fire master on duty Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions at the lake are difficult because of darkness and relatively high winds.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the rescue department, the ship’s fate is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="14">Apparently the ship does not have a leak.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the evacuation operation, divers will check the situation in the lake bottom.</seg>
<seg id="16">M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is a lake ship currently operating as a restaurant ship. Its passenger limit is 180 persons.</seg>
<seg id="17">The ship also has a conference room available for rent for private use.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the ship’s website, the cruise ship has been renovated in 2001, 2014, and 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2">A disagreement about money overshadows boxer Robert Helenius’ tonight's match against Erkan Teper.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ilta-Sanomat reported today on the complaint by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Master of Laws trained on the bench Jussi Kokkila, in which over 80,000 euros worth of unpaid manager fees with penal interest are demanded from Helenius.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the complaint, Helminen and Kokkola worked for Helenius between 15.4.2014 and 30.1.2015.</seg>
<seg id="5">We have attempted to settle this, but there is no other option.</seg>
<seg id="6">There was a clear assignment here, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.</seg>
<seg id="7">Helenius’ current manager, Markus Sundman, sent Ilta-Sanomat a repsonse, which narrates the boxer’s view of the events.</seg>
<seg id="8">Helenius denies to have an obligation to pay the required sum.</seg>
<seg id="9">As stated in the response, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation, and promised to be able to organise matches and sponsor income for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the verbatim agreement, Helenius was obligated only to pay a percentage of his matches as fees.</seg>
<seg id="11">Again and again there were assurances that Helenius does not need to pay anything, just to receive the income they organise.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is also a normal and only practice in professional athletes’ managerial action.</seg>
<seg id="13">There never was an agreement about paid work, and that would also have been ill-advised in Helenius’ situation, Sundman explains in a message he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="14">There never was a written agreement about the co-operation</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the response, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the income distribution in written from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not manage to make a draft until the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">He discovered the draft to be bad for him, and discontinued the co-operation with Kokkila and Helminen.</seg>
<seg id="17">Helenius had no matches while associating with Kokkila and Helminen.</seg>
<seg id="18">A year after their co-operation ended, Helenius received an “unspecified but big” invoice for manager work.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year a complaint was filed with the same allegations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Helenius regards Helminen and Kokkila's subsequent action as cowardly, the response states.</seg>
<seg id="21">Today Helenius faces Erkan Teper, the seventh from IBF heavyweight contender list, in a match in Stuttgart.</seg>

<seg id="2">Artist and music producer Ilkka ‘Ile’ Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli for decades.</seg>
<seg id="3">A seasoned radio host and journalist Erkki Pällli passed away of terminal liver cancer aged 83.</seg>
<seg id="4">The host's obituary was published in Sunday’s Helsingin Sanomat.</seg>
<seg id="5">The obituary says Pälli died on 3 September.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pälli shared his serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">Back then the announcement was seen also by Ile Vainio, who grieved the news about a friend's destiny.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a way he said his goodbyes already earlier in Facebook, Ile Vainio said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Vainio says Erkki Pälli was a multi-talented professional, who became an excellent journalist.</seg>
<seg id="10">He remembers Pälli as a popular person, quick on the uptake and telling funny tales.</seg>
<seg id="11">I’ve known Erkki since I was a small boy and went to Finnlevy the first time as a 12-year-old to start working at their warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is when I met Erkki.</seg>
<seg id="13">Back then he worked as Finnlevy publicist and had different duties, Ile Vainio remembers.</seg>
<seg id="14">As I was promoted to a music producer and made records, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was present as a regular journalist to write stories about the artists.</seg>
<seg id="15">He was always well-informed and I saw the passion he had for entertainment, music, and people.</seg>
<seg id="16">When Erkki interviewed someone, he managed to get close to his interviewees.</seg>
<seg id="17">He was an amiable man and a good journalist.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many knew him as a respected Yle radio host, but he also wrote excellent articles.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many time Erkki interviewed also me.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was a good speaker, Vainio applauds.</seg>
<seg id="21">Over decades, in addition to journalist work, Pälli also worked at Fazer record company together with Toivo Kärki.</seg>
<seg id="22">He was the music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri’s records.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, Pälli’s greatest passion was radio work, which he did with his own, unique style.</seg>
<seg id="24">He worked in the radio since 1960s, and became familiar to many listeners from Yle's ether.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pälli retired in 1998.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a stay-at-home mother in Finland - got an idea of a comic and lack of drawing skills did not slow her down</seg>
<seg id="2">Luomuhömppä (‘organic silly’) originated from an utterance of my husband, when he suggested it could be a person in a story I was developing, describes Sari Piippo, a comic blogger from Espoo, stay-at-home mother, and former EU translator.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sari Piippo says she was an EU-translator in Brussels concentrating on economy and law, until the family’s fourth child was born ten years ago and they became returning migrants.</seg>
<seg id="4">I’ve loved being a stay-at-home mother.</seg>
<seg id="5">This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I started to wonder what to do when I grow up, and even my youngest one started to be pretty big.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then in 2014, comic came in.</seg>
<seg id="7">Piippo says she had never even dreamed about making a comic, even though she had been reading Donald Duck, Tintin, and Asterix ever since she was little.</seg>
<seg id="8">I hadn’t drawn since childhood, but when these scripts for Luomuhömppä then started to emerge, the situation changed.</seg>
<seg id="9">First I created some dozens of scripts for my own pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="10">My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I didn’t manage to persuade her to help me until summer 2016, when I bribed Viivi with a drawing tablet.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her enthusiasm lasted for about a dozen strips, and then I had to start trying myself, Piippo laughs and says the drawing tablet was a great supporter for her.</seg>
<seg id="12">A drawing tablet is an easy and handy way to try to get something done.</seg>
<seg id="13">I didn’t even try to draw on a paper, Piippo describes her relationship with drawing, which she usually does in the evenings.</seg>
<seg id="14">Scripts pop up in my mind all the time, but usually I never finish a comic at one go.</seg>
<seg id="15">A single three-panel strip may take even several hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">I may do one panel at a time and I love to play with colours.</seg>
<seg id="17">Beginning to draw is always the most diffficult thing, since drawing isn’t my forte.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sari Piippo says that when it comes to modern comics in newspapers, she appreciates for example Dilbert by Scott Adams.</seg>
<seg id="19">Characters of Luomuhömppä include a carrot-figured mother, obsessed with everything organic and head full of lettuce hair.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other characters are Mies (Husband), Pissis (Teen Girl), and Kaksoset (Twins).</seg>
<seg id="21">In the world of Luomuhömppä you are what you eat.</seg>
<seg id="22">The ideas for the comic come from the creator's own life and social media.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sari Piippo does not want to preach or force any ideas, even though there are occasionally more serious subjects in Luomuhömppä.</seg>
<seg id="24">Piippo says she has her husband and children read the comic.</seg>
<seg id="25">It’s a really great feeling to look at a comic you’ve drawn and think that this is what I did today.</seg>
<seg id="26">There's challenge enough for a stay-at-home mother!</seg>

<seg id="1">Rehn pondered the possibility of Europe escalating in a trade war at Yle “We must see the next tweet”</seg>
<seg id="2">The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the world economy as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="3">Growth forecasts have been lowered throughout Europe, and also the Bank of Finland has slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.</seg>
<seg id="4">Speaking at Yle Ykkösaamu, Governor Olli Rehn said that even though increasing tension has no direct effect on European flow of trade, it does weaken the trust, which in turn is reflected on companies’ investment decisions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The same applies to the impacts of Finnish companies’ exports.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rehn thinks so far Europe has taken good care of its duties.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has been able to create a truce with the United States, and, for its part, calmed the situation down also with China and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="8">Rehn does not think that Europe will be ground under the feet of a trade war.</seg>
<seg id="9">We must see the next tweet and make estimations after that.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our partner in Washington is quite unpredictable, he however said in the Yle interview.</seg>
<seg id="11">Europe also has its own risks.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of them is the third largest euro area economy Italy, which is also one of the most indebted states in the euro area and the whole Western world.</seg>
<seg id="13">The market had a severe reaction to a budget showing a clear deficit presented by the Italian government on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="14">Next year's deficit is over 2.4 per cent of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rehn considers Italian situation to be alarming.</seg>
<seg id="16">Five per cent of the country’s loan stock are problem loans, and over ten per cent are unregulated loans.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, the public finances are shaky, and again it seems that the country is going to exceed its liabilities in relation to its European partners.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maybe we should not yet be imagining new crises, Rehn replied when inquired whether Italy is leading Europe to a new economic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="19">Another matter taxing Europe is British departure from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rehn hopes it can be settled at peace.</seg>
<seg id="21">A quarrelsome exit would have much more negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rehn began as the Bank of Finland Governor in July.</seg>
<seg id="23">European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi will retire in a bit over a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">The discussion about his successor has begun.</seg>
<seg id="25">Both Rehn's and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen’s names have been brought up.</seg>
<seg id="26">It probably is all right, if there are Finnish names involved, Rehn said, adding that he has no further comments on the matter.</seg>

<seg id="1">A missing mushroom picker found thanks to an ‘unconventional experiment’</seg>
<seg id="2">The Finnish Police's drone skills are the top of the world: ‘We are asked to provide training’</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the Director of the Police University College, in addition to looking for missing persons, the police can use a drone in crime scene investigation and in intelligence operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, using a drone, Oulu police found a missing mushroom picker in Raahe in only a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Director of the Police University College, Kimmo Himberg, tweeted about the case and mentioned for example that ‘thanks to unconventional experimenting and efficient training, we are at the top of the world also in this’.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drone is a fairly new device, and even newer in police operations.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are no statistics available about Finnish police being a master in drone use.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to Himberg, there is a wide consensus about this.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has been obvious for example when Finnish police's experiences have been reported in international events.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is a lot of interest towards it elsewhere, Himberg says.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are many, who are are keen to visit Finland to see the police’s drone operations.</seg>
<seg id="12">We are asked to provide training.</seg>
<seg id="13">Becomes more and more common</seg>
<seg id="14">Himberg points out that in Finnish winter conditions, finding a missing person as soon as possible is vital.</seg>
<seg id="15">As stated, in Raahe case the missing person was found in just a couple of minutes using a drone.</seg>
<seg id="16">Finnish Police has already trained hundreds of drone pilots.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Himberg, the plan is to train more.</seg>
<seg id="18">Already now the drone is used a lot in police operations, and their use will increase and become more common in the future.</seg>
<seg id="19">I dare to say this, Himberg says.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition to finding missing people, Himberg says the police can use drones in, for example, accident or crime scene investigation and in certain kinds of intelligence operations.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example if an area must be reviewed from a distance, if there is a possible threat of violence there.</seg>
<seg id="22">In these cases, a drone can be used for advance inquiry.</seg>

<seg id="1">What is a good leader like?</seg>
<seg id="2">This week Finland has heard a lot of discussion about leadership.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chairman of Nokia, Risto Siilasmaa, discussed his book Transforming Nokia that deals with his leadership philosophy in an interview for Helsingin Sanomat (HS).</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time he criticises his predecessor chairman Jorma Ollila's leadership style.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ollila categorically denied the claims, but also earlier reports on Nokia have discussed the leaders’ inability to work as a team; the culture of fear and silence that in part caused the downfall of the mobile phone business.</seg>
<seg id="6">The risk-taking capacity and agility of the company's rise period were lost.</seg>
<seg id="7">This week also saw the business life mega event Nordic Business Forum organised in Helsinki. The event gathered the cream of Finnish business to Messukeskus.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 stars of business world were seen on the stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was a lot of talk about good leadership.</seg>
<seg id="10">Leadership theory legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader must have the courage to take a company to the future also when everything is going fine.</seg>
<seg id="11">The problem is that decisions are made by those, who are most mentally bound to the decisions of the past.</seg>
<seg id="12">John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods supermarket chain known for its extensive organic product selection, said a leader has to be able to convey the company meaning to the whole staff.</seg>
<seg id="13">And that meaning has to be something more besides simply making profit for the owners.</seg>
<seg id="14">Author of a successful book on introverts, Susan Cain explained research has proven the most successful leaders to be humble.</seg>
<seg id="15">They act in a peaceful, quiet, and determined manner.</seg>
<seg id="16">Often they are introverts.</seg>
<seg id="17">Professor of Finance Aswath Damodaran reminded the listeners that a good leader's characteristics must match the company’s life cycle stage.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the early stage of the company a leader must be able to tell a story on which the company's future is founded.</seg>
<seg id="19">A company grown to a mature stage needs a leader who know the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="20">These lessons were attended by 7,500 Nordic Business Forum visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.</seg>
<seg id="21">They were at a risk of an information overload.</seg>
<seg id="22">Being a good leader requires a lot.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why leadership so often fails, also on the highest level.</seg>
<seg id="24">Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.</seg>
<seg id="25">They had a friendly discussion behind-the-scenes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Though they were hardly contemplating whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="27">And their humility was not easy to estimate as an outsider.</seg>

<seg id="1">Students act a rare treat: a classical tragedy - simple Oresteia impresses with its visuality.</seg>
<seg id="2">Classical tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stages.</seg>
<seg id="3">For example, there has not been a classical tragedy in the Finnish National Theatre since Sophocles’ Philoctetes in 1998.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now Theatre Academy takes the only complete classical trilogy, Oresteia by Aeschylus, to a tour that begins from the National Theatre.</seg>
<seg id="5">Beginning in 2015, the Lavat auki! productions have actor students from the Theatre Academy working internationally together with a professional director.</seg>
<seg id="6">This fourth production, just like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who resides in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="7">Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in April.</seg>
<seg id="8">Roiha’s adaptation of Oresteia laudably condenses the tale of how the curse upon the doomed House of Atreus is lifted and a constitutional state is formed to 80 minutes by condensing especially the chorus parts.</seg>
<seg id="9">The playmanages to be quite faithful to the spirit of Kirsi Simonsuuri’s excellent translation (2003).</seg>
<seg id="10">Dramatic lights and presentation revealing the sides of the theatre space emphasise the simple and clear stage thinking.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the centre of it alternates the dynamics between actors playing main roles, stepping forward from the chorus in turn, and the chorus.</seg>
<seg id="12">The performance utilises both double and triple portrayals of the main roles.</seg>
<seg id="13">The actors never leave the stage, so also for example the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the war of Troy, and his prize of war, Cassandra, are shown on the stage, unlike in the classical tradition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Of course the performance does not even claim to be faithful to the classical performance tradition.</seg>
<seg id="15">If anything, the viewer is presented with a modern interpretation, faithful to the text, and continuously aware of its ritual-like roots.</seg>
<seg id="16">Roiha has managed to create a rhythmic group from the Master-level actor students, a group that performs as a tight-knight team, even as a single organism.</seg>
<seg id="17">The chorus parts especially are where the actors and their very expressive, sculpture-like group formations do themselves justice in the bare stage adorned only by a white curtain.</seg>
<seg id="18">Impressive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oresteia's performance tour continues in Kouvola and Oulu Theatres.</seg>

<seg id="1">The security of ladies and men in shops must be guaranteed</seg>
<seg id="2">The first time I was paid for a newspaper story was in 1984.</seg>
<seg id="3">With this level of experience, when a news story manages to astonish me, it is usually a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="4">When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of workers in retail, I was astonished and occasionally even a bit angry.</seg>
<seg id="5">For that story, I also talked with Erika Kähärä, Service Union United (PAM) specialist in working environments.</seg>
<seg id="6">She says the crime statistics do not reveal the actual situation.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is a growing problem, even though employers naturally claim otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="8">The police are informed only about those cases that are clearly serious, and many real violent situations are left unreported.</seg>
<seg id="9">‘Based on the Occupational Safety and Health Act the companies certainly have a responsibility to compile statistics of their close call situations, but these statistics are for internal use only, and their information is not collected anywhere’, she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mental injuries are not included in the statistics.</seg>
<seg id="11">Violent situations always have had the problem that there do not always result in physical injuries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Despite this, psychological traumas can be much more severe than bruises and cuts.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult to draw a line between a violent situation and an impending violent situation, since also aggressive threats of a certain level must be considers as violence - even though there was no physical violence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Too many are afraid at their workplace, even though no actual violence would happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some neighbourhoods are troubled.</seg>
<seg id="16">The shop has hired security guards.</seg>
<seg id="17">When the business opening hours became deregulated, there was a lot of discussion also in the media about its effects to the salespersons’ safety.</seg>
<seg id="18">‘Back then quite a few employers organised security guards for at least the night-time hours and to prevent working alone’, Kähärä commented.</seg>
<seg id="19">When nothing happens, wrong conclusions are drawn.</seg>
<seg id="20">This seems to have had an effective influence, but this brings about a new negative trend.</seg>
<seg id="21">When security managed to control the disturbances, an impression was created that this security would be unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now many places are looking for solutions to eliminate expensive security services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Petty assault is an actionable offence, and it is quite understandable that an assaulted salesperson does not want to make a request for investigation about an offender who usually lives close to the shop.</seg>
<seg id="24">But, according to a subsection in the same 2011 act, petty assault is under a prosecutioner’s jurisdiction, if it takes place in a workplace.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think we need precedents now.</seg>
<seg id="26">The next time a shop lady or man is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor prosecute.</seg>
<seg id="27">After a court would put a few assailants to prison, and if the judgement is from the tougher end of the penal scale, the manners would smarten up.</seg>
<seg id="28">A society that requires a small place food shop to be open nearly day and nigh should guarantee the safety of shop assistants.</seg>

<seg id="2">This year, the beauty queen coronation won’t be seen traditionally on TV, but it’s broadcast via Viafree site.</seg>
<seg id="3">The show will be hosted by ex Miss Finland, Heidi Sohlberg, and the host of Viasat's and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.</seg>
<seg id="4">The host for backstage and red carpet is Janni Hussi.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before live broadcast, the host trio informed the invited guests and media representatives present about how the broadcast will progress.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the beginning, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula resounding applauds.</seg>
<seg id="7">Scream now, ladies!</seg>
<seg id="8">Look at our male host, Sohlberg enthused over her colleague while the audience cheered.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many Miss Finlands from earlier years follow the contest from the first row.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among others, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi were sitting next to each other, and Sohlberg cracked a joke to either of them.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sara, remember that Iiro is married!</seg>
<seg id="12">Sohlberg cracked, looking at Saras.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most likely Sohberg directed her joke to recently divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though she first looked confused.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sieppi discussed her divorce the first time in Ilta-Sanomat weeked newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">The beauty queen said she doesn’t want to publicly open up about the reasons for the divorce, because that is just between her and Roope Salminen.</seg>
<seg id="16">She said she’s in no hurry to find a new relationship, but that she is going to focus on herself.</seg>
<seg id="17">I will focus on my own things, and above all, will begin to live my life by myself, Sara Sieppi said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Harjula's marital status emerged also later, when Sohlberg accidentally called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.</seg>
<seg id="19">The host trio shared a laugh at the blunder.</seg>
<seg id="20">Wasn't Iiro married, or how was it?</seg>

<seg id="1">An Ostrobothnian man tortured his domestic partner by slashing, burning and feeding a strong sauce to her</seg>
<seg id="2">Pohjanmaa (Ostrobothnia) District Court has sentenced the 34-year-old Kokkola resident to three years of imprisonment for the numerous crimes against his domestic partner.</seg>
<seg id="3">The means of commission of the offence include, among others, a belt, a cable, and cable ties.</seg>
<seg id="4">The court sentenced these objects forfeited to the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most severe charge concerned a suspected aggravated rape.</seg>
<seg id="6">This charge was however dismissed by the district court.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Kokkola man was considered guilty of four assaults, and aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty, and two malicious damages.</seg>
<seg id="8">The crimes were committed between the 26th of last March and 24th of last May.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the final deeds, the man was apprehended and detained a couple of days later.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Thursday of the past week, Pohjanmaa District Court passed its judgement and ruled that the 34-year-old must continue to be kept in Vaasa prison.</seg>
<seg id="11">No proof about the rape</seg>
<seg id="12">The 34-year-old was also accused of two aggravated deprivations of liberty and of an aggravated rape on the 22nd of May.</seg>
<seg id="13">The court however dropped these charges as unsubstantiated.</seg>
<seg id="14">The case was tried behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The district court judge gave a public report on the sentence, though.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the district court judge, the accused had directed violence, threatening, and coercion to his domestic partner in situations where she was tied.</seg>
<seg id="17">The accused slashed his victim with a knife, burned her with a cigarette, fed her strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on her.</seg>
<seg id="18">With its sentence, the court ordered that the means of commission of the offence were to be forfeited to the state: a belt and a cable, cable ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife, and a billhook.</seg>
<seg id="19">Four witnesses</seg>
<seg id="20">According to the district court, the parties continued living together between the deeds.</seg>
<seg id="21">The judicial decision states that a large number of the most serious deeds happened in the end of the crime period.</seg>
<seg id="22">Four witnesses were heard in the court, two women and two men.</seg>
<seg id="23">The 34-year-old must pay 5800 euros as compensation for pain, ache, suffering, and temporary damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">Doubtfully he has such money, since the convict already has earlier debts in collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">The imprisonment is not the man's first.</seg>
<seg id="26">Iltalehti will not publish the name of the convict in order to protect the victim’r privacy.</seg>
<seg id="27">During the time of writing, the recent district court sentence is not non-appealable.</seg>

<seg id="1">JHL anticipates: Industrial action beginning tomorrow will be visible in children’s daycare and in social and health services</seg>
<seg id="2">Overtime and shift-trading bans beginning tomorrow in the public and welfare sectors concern especially social and health services and children's daycare, estimates Päivi Niemi-Laine, President of JHL (the Trade Union for the Public and Welfare Sectors).</seg>
<seg id="3">The impact will be wide, and it will most certainly manifest in not having enough staff available.</seg>
<seg id="4">Everyone has to think about how to collect their children.</seg>
<seg id="5">The employer’s task now is to take care of the services and that no one’s life is in danger, Niemi-Laine says to STT.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was visible also in the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift-trading because of agreement negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Through their flexibility, the employers have made possible to not hire staff, but use employees’ overtime or shift-trading.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is not yet an industrial action.</seg>
<seg id="9">When talking about occupational safety and health, it is a normal thing to take care that each employee has regular working hours and works only those regular hours.</seg>
<seg id="10">With these actions, JHL opposes the governments attempts to weaken the lay-off protection in small businesses.</seg>
<seg id="11">Labour market director for municipal employers Markku Jalonen will not estimate the effects of overtime and shift-trading bans in advance.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he does not believe them to be very revolutionary, even if the services can weaken.</seg>
<seg id="13">Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the possible preparations.</seg>
<seg id="14">The public, welfare and technical sector covers such a wide area that it is difficult to say anything.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effects can very quite a lot depending on field, region, and employer, Jalonen told STT.</seg>
<seg id="16">Jalonen said some experiences were received already last week when the Finnish Union of Practical Nurses Super and the Union of Health and Social Care Professionals Tehy, among others, organised similar three-day actions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their effects remained quite small.</seg>
<seg id="18">JHL overtime and trade-shift ban applies to for example employees in municipalities, church, and state, as well as in private social and health sector.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example family daycare providers have been excluded from the ban.</seg>
<seg id="20">At this stage, the industrial action applies to nearly 100,000 JHL members.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to Niemi-Laine, JHL actions can potentially last for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The union is prepared to take other industrial actions, if drafting of the lay-off bill continues.</seg>
<seg id="23">The government should now recognise that they are running against a wall in high speed.</seg>
<seg id="24">In Jalonen’s opinion, both the trade union movement and the government must meet the other halfway.</seg>
<seg id="25">The unusual thing here is that people are already pulling out their big guns, even though the proposition has yet to be made, wonders Jalonen.</seg>

<seg id="1">Great Barrier Reef is formed by children and adults - performance exercises consist of learning the motions of a ray and a sea horse</seg>
<seg id="2">Great Barrier Reef by Other Spaces collective had its premiere last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday was its second performance in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Just like the previous performance of the group, Great Barrier Reef is a performance that is created together with the audience from the beginning until the end.</seg>
<seg id="4">This time, however, also a more clearly-defined performance is formed to refresh and distil the perceptions from the beginning exercises.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is plenty of fantastical magic in this theatre play also for children participants.</seg>
<seg id="6">A child’s view has been considered also in the preparatory stage of the performance.</seg>
<seg id="7">Still, Great Barrier Reef is not a children’s performance, but a performance formed in co-operation between the adults and the children.</seg>
<seg id="8">It gives the adults knowledge and observations about the way children receive information and create art.</seg>
<seg id="9">The children’s ability to throw themselves in the exercises and common games also dispels the distance between grown-ups and children.</seg>
<seg id="10">Great Barrier Reef has a little bit of a fairy-tale ballet, circuit training, and nature-themed lesson in it, but its final setting is organised around different visits to non-human situations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Great Barrier Reef begins with learning about corals and about movements of organisms and fish who live within the reef.</seg>
<seg id="12">Six different exercise groups teach for example about the motions of a ray and a seahorse.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally a performance lasting a little under an hour is formed, and in it the music, lights, shiny paints and costumes help in getting to know the life within the coral reef.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Great Barrier Reef, the participants are both diving people observing the life within the reef, and corals that are being observed.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also play the part of organisms observing corals.</seg>
<seg id="16">The looks at many different directions and perceptions create a performance that is dense and teeming with life.</seg>
<seg id="17">To be an organism’s view, and organism observing a view, or an organism or view observing another organism - and all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Children seem to have no problems to do this.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other Spaces collective’s exercises aim to reach the limit between thinking and action, but it is challenging to reach it when the group is comprised of both children and adults.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, children’s participation makes it more meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="21">After the workshop, a silent demonstration for endangered corals is organised at Sitratori.</seg>
<seg id="22">One should not let themselves be hardened by the destruction surpassing human understanding, even though it can be difficult to understand the significance of practising one’s own compassion in the face of these visions of destruction.</seg>
<seg id="23">Other Spaces has created its performance in such a way that it honours the variety of life also with a political gesture.</seg>
<seg id="24">There are also other generations, other consciousnesses, other species and their future generations it clears the way for.</seg>

<seg id="5">According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Security Police visited the Defence and the Foreign Rights Committees to tell about the ongoing investigation.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is primarily considered as financial crime.</seg>
<seg id="7">They were rather strict about not speculating about anything else, Kanerva commented in the Yle interview.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to Yle information, the attached material so far has not shown any connection to national security, but the investigation is just beginning.</seg>
<seg id="9">We have no way of knowing what might yet be revealed, one of Yle's interviewees stated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The extensive house searches started a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on mainland beg the question about whether the investigation is simply about financial crime or if it has something to do with Finnish internal security.</seg>
<seg id="11">Earlier this week, Iltalehti put together an article scrutinising the allegations both pro and con.</seg>

<seg id="1">Video: a dream goal saved Liverpool from the first loss in the series</seg>
<seg id="2">Liverpool winning streak in the Premier League came to an end, but it was still the happier team after a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">This Sunday it will be exactly one year after Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and left with a 1-0 away win.</seg>
<seg id="4">Back then Pep Guardiola’s combination sent a signal to the whole Premier League that City is now serious.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everyone remembers how the last season ended.</seg>
<seg id="6">And surely Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp had the same idea when coming to West London.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Reds had started the League with six consecutive wins.</seg>
<seg id="8">Liverpool had a stronger start, and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to control his end of the field alone.</seg>
<seg id="9">As for Chelsea, on Wednesday they won a fine Football League Cup away win on Anfield Road.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then Eden Hazard came off the bench to decide the match with a beautiful individual performance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obviously now Hazard was playing from the very first minutes.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the 25th minute he first played a tight triangle with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally the Croatian saw Hazard rushing forward and sent him a perfectly balanced through ball.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hazard strayed a bit to the edge of the penalty box, but from there managed to sweep a perfect left-footed volley in to the lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">Pool's Brasilian goalie Alisson was a bit slow with his save and only managed to touch the ball with his fingertips.</seg>
<seg id="16">Klopp must have felt the losing position being slightly unfair, since almost right after Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's shot from the goal line.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the second half, also Chelsea keeper Kepa saw some serious action.</seg>
<seg id="18">Basque goalie had a quick reaction to Sadio Mané’s shot, and pushed the ball from the foot of the goal post to a corner kick.</seg>
<seg id="19">As for the other end, Alisson resetted Hazard's fast break with his dive.</seg>
<seg id="20">The guests’ best chance came on the 72nd minute, as James Milner's crossing found Bobby Firmino.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, the star Brazilian's header was directed towards his national team mate David Luiz, which saved the home team's lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even that didn't hold anymore on the 89th minute, when substitute Daniel Sturridge had a free shot from 25 metres.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sturridge was playing on his old home stadium, and to honour that, the forward threw a powerful shot in the upper corner.</seg>
<seg id="24">Liverpool's winning start of the League came to an end with the 1-1 draw, but it still holds the top position - together with Manchester City.</seg>
<seg id="25">Chelsea is also still going for the championship with only two points from the top.</seg>

<seg id="1">Discussion about clock switching divides the people</seg>
<seg id="2">I remember some decades ago a newspaper asking several Finnish influential persons what divides Finnish people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Only response I remember was Juice Leskinen’s: ‘Nen’ ending.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some surnames have a ‘nen’ ending, some do not.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dividing lines can spring up anywhere, and this was one of the possible reasons.</seg>
<seg id="6">In EU, Finland has achieved that this annual clock changing is about to become history.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many agree that switching clocks twice annually has been simply foolery, and that it has caused many problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest part of the solution, even though it has not been that easy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The most difficult part now is to choose the ultimate time: current summer or winter time, or some other time zone.</seg>
<seg id="10">The people can also have their say on otakantaa.fi site.</seg>
<seg id="11">The online survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and it will be open until Friday 12 October.</seg>
<seg id="12">Discussions are heated both around coffee tables and in social media, and everyone has something to say about the matter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those favouring winter time justify their opinion with the effects of morning sunlight to peoples’ well-being, and those defending summer time with the effects of evening light on peoples’ will to spend time outside and that way to their well-being.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both sides have solid supporters and good arguments.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to research, morning light sets the pace for a person’s day and increases energy levels.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the other hand, if a person does not particularly suffer from waking up when it’s dark, light increases the time people spend outside and better enables for example autumn yard work.</seg>
<seg id="17">The amount of extra light hours after a normal work day has already been calculated.</seg>
<seg id="18">I would rather take both, but it’s unlucky that we cannot help our location in the northern corner of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="19">The winters are anyway too dark, the summers too light for many people.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is typical for discussions about this matter to support one’s own views and oppose the other side very uncompromisingly.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is no need to listen to the justifications of the opposing side, since the most important thing is how one feels about the matter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since almost everyone has an opinion about this matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to change someone’s mind.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is effort well wasted.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is easy to have an argument about this topic, since it does not require to really go into details, and an opinion is justification enough.</seg>
<seg id="25">These kinds of topics are generally those, who incite most furious, and most futile, debate.</seg>
<seg id="26">Obviously it will be annoying if a wrong option is chosen, but we will surely reconcile ourselves with it.</seg>
<seg id="27">And, should life feel too glum, it always offers a suitable scapegoat.</seg>

<seg id="2">Electric car manufacturer Tesla and the company’s CEO Elon Musk have settled their case with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, who regulate the U.S. securities industry.</seg>
<seg id="3">SEC suspected Musk to be guilty of a securities fraud, and Musk was in danger to be removed from the management of the company he founded.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla CEO.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, Musk has to step down for three years as chairman of the board for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="6">The company has to hire an outside chairman.</seg>
<seg id="7">Musk will also be under stricter supervision.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the settlement, Tesla will have to appoint two independent directors and oversee Musk’s communications in the future.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, both Tesla and Musk have to pay $20 million (ca. 17 million euro) to settle the case.</seg>
<seg id="10">‘The resolution is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla’s shareholders’, says SEC co-director Steven Peikin.</seg>
<seg id="11">The case began in August, when Musk tweeted that he could take Tesla private.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also wrote that funding has been secured.</seg>
<seg id="13">This tweet caused Tesla’s stock price to rise temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="14">SEC suspected Musk guilty of a securities fraud.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to SEC, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not discussed the deal with the company’s other directors or potential financing partners.</seg>
<seg id="16">In practice, SEC charged Musk with misleading the investors.</seg>
<seg id="17">On Friday, SEC announced it is going to sue the company and Musk.</seg>
<seg id="18">SEC told it is seeking to impose fines on Musk and to ban him from being able to hold officer or director positions at publicly-traded companies.</seg>
<seg id="19">SEC’s summons scared the investors, and Tesla's share took a nosedive.</seg>

<seg id="2">The death toll from Indonesia's quake and tsunami disaster has soared to at least 832, the disaster agency said according to news agency AFP.</seg>
<seg id="3">The number of deaths is believed to grow higher, since the investigation of damages is till ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Jusuf Kalla predicts the death toll could reach into the thousands.</seg>
<seg id="5">An earthquake on Friday triggered a tsunami that surged over the Palu city in the island of Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="6">A warning about a tsunami was issued right after the quake, but it was quickly cancelled.</seg>

<seg id="2">Many British politicians were subjected to nuisance after their personal details were leaked because of an app security flaw.</seg>
<seg id="3">The troublemakers had access to e.g. Ministers’ phone numbers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The app in question was a mobile application used for Britain’s Conservatives’ party conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">For example Brexiteers Michael Gove, Secretary for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were among those targeted for disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several ministers received nuisance calls.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because of a security flaw, members of the public were able to access the politicians profiles in the Conservative party annual conference’s mobile application.</seg>
<seg id="8">They could enter the profiles using a politician’s email address, which is widely available online.</seg>
<seg id="9">The person entering a profile could view and edit the data stored within.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a brief moment, someone managed to swap Boris Johnson's profile picture for pornography and change his job title to a libellous one.</seg>
<seg id="11">Michael Gove’s picture was changed to one of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian described the problem by writing that the conference app allows one to log in as other people with their email address.</seg>
<seg id="13">After that it is possible to view the contact details in a person’s profile and, for example, send messages as them.</seg>
<seg id="14">The conference app essentially made every journalist, politician and attendee’s mobile number public, Foster criticised.</seg>
<seg id="15">A Conservative party spokesperson apologised for the breach.</seg>
<seg id="16">They said the technical issue has been resolved and the app now functions securely.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Wall Finland quiz show's audience has a huge number of applauding Poles every week</seg>
<seg id="2">The sharp-eyed viewers paid attention to the studio audience reactions in The Wall Finland quiz show.</seg>
<seg id="3">The American television format The Wall has spread quickly worldwide, and its Finnish version arrived at channel Nelonen last Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hosted by Heikki Paasonen, the game show has been filmed in Poland in the same studio, where the other international productions of the format are made.</seg>
<seg id="5">The shooting possibilities of the studio in Poland are exceptional, because the format's tall, 12-metre game wall requires a generous space.</seg>
<seg id="6">During the opening episode, social media highlighted the show's studio audience, which people guessed to be Polish.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was a Twitter discussion about whether the possible Poles sitting in the studio understand anything about the game played in Finnish.</seg>
<seg id="8">Unne Sormunen, managing director of Finnish programmes at Nelonen, explains the issue to Iltalehti.</seg>
<seg id="9">She says the studio audience consists of the players’ close friends, other Finns, expatriate Finns living in Poland, and Polish viewers.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Finnish production audience consists of international applauders, just like the audiences of other countries’ The Wall episodes, filmed in the same production space.</seg>
<seg id="11">Finald also has these groups, the so-called professional audiences that visit different programmes’ shoots, Sormunen explaines.</seg>
<seg id="12">She reminds people that following the game is not so difficult to understand, even if one does not understand the language it is played in.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is easy to separate the red and green balls falling from the wall.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, there are interpreters present in the studio to translate for those speaking a foreign language.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously everything that happens to the studio floor manager.</seg>
<seg id="16">The manager then gives instructions to the audience and describes for example what kinds of jokes people are telling and what is the current situation, Sormunen says.</seg>
<seg id="17">She compares the situation with how things were done recently with David Hasselhoff in a Finnish production.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland filming here in Finland.</seg>
<seg id="19">He had a continuous simultaneous interpretation coming to his earbud the whole time, and he knew everything that was said in Finnish, Sormunen summarises.</seg>

<seg id="1">7 most beautiful lights - this is how you recognise a good lamp</seg>
<seg id="2">Bring the space to life, create an appropriate atmosphere to the decor, and read a book without tiring your eyes.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is worthwhile to invest in good lighting.</seg>
<seg id="4">We collected three good reasons to investi in lighting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tips came from Innolux Director of Sales and Marketing Tarja Jokiniemi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Do a favour to your eyes</seg>
<seg id="7">The importance of lighting grows together with age.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sufficient light can help in those problems many people get when they age, as visual acuity decreases and more and more suffer from glares.</seg>
<seg id="9">As one gets older, also the need for light grows.</seg>
<seg id="10">A person in their sixties requires three times the light than a person in their twenties.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is worthwhile investing in the therapeutic effects of light and in lamp qualities already for health reasons.</seg>
<seg id="12">A good lamp gives enough light but doesn't cause glares, Jokiniemi gives tips.</seg>
<seg id="13">Create beauty around you</seg>
<seg id="14">A beautiful decor is brought out only with suitable light solutions.</seg>
<seg id="15">Modern home decorator has plenty to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="16">A subdued japandi style combining Scandinavian and Japanese things is currently popular.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, also the modern and playful retro style drawing inspiration from the 70s has had a boom in popularity, with its different metallic tones and icecream colours.</seg>
<seg id="18">Authenticity charms in the same way it does in other house decor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather, and bamboo.</seg>
<seg id="20">Express your personality</seg>
<seg id="21">People invest in their homes much more than before, and decor has became a way to express one’s personality.</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead of mass production, people want to have a tailored, even a bold lamp that has a story to tell.</seg>
<seg id="23">People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products with a well-known origin and designer.</seg>
<seg id="24">They are very design-aware, Jokiniemi says.</seg>
<seg id="25">One does not necessarily buy the most recent trendy lamp to one’s home, but rather a timeless classic one has saved many years for.</seg>
<seg id="26">Certain kinds of timeless, jewel-like, elegant classics hang on from year to year, Jokiniemi says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian intelligence services’ sabotage activities have a long tradition</seg>
<seg id="2">There is no reason to suppose that the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation (SVR) or The Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU) would have abandoned this mode of operation.</seg>
<seg id="3">During Soviet times, so called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.</seg>
<seg id="4">The name comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.</seg>
<seg id="5">The agents of Soviet security service KGB working in western countries prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin (1922-2004) who defected to the West.</seg>
<seg id="6">His information was published in Christopher Andrew’s books in the late 1990s and in the beginning of 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="7">Among others, the targets included harbours, shipyards, big dams, oil refineries, and gas pipe connections.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Germany, KGB acquired Bunderswehr, railroad, gamekeeper, and road worker uniforms and accessories to be used by DRG groups in cover operations.</seg>
<seg id="9">This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in the Crimea in February 2014; they dressed in local Ukrainian riot police's gear, set up checkpoints on the roads leading from peninsula to Ukraine, and sealed Crimea off from its mother country.</seg>
<seg id="10">During the cold war, agents hid equipment packages with mines, explosives, detonators, and communication devices in the ground for sabotage groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">As late as in 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, and when officials sprayed it with a water cannon, its booby-trap detonated.</seg>

<seg id="2">American Beck Wathers wrote a book 18 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man's own experiences.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tonight’s movie is based on them.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everest has its premiere in Finnish TV now.</seg>
<seg id="6">In May 1996, climbers on Mount Everest were overtaken by a disastrous snowstorm .</seg>
<seg id="7">Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 direction tells about the fight for survival that has been covered plenty of times.</seg>
<seg id="8">There have been previous films - and documents - about the tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The real events are looked through also in this article.</seg>
<seg id="10">22 years ago, the world's highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was precisely Hall, who was Weathers’ guide.</seg>
<seg id="13">An eye surgery performed just before his departure to Nepal might have saved Weathers’ life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Because of that and the air pressure, he lost his eye sight, which meant he had to pass the climb to the summit.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rob Hall continued to climb and didn’t return.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, Weathers’ life-and-death struggle had only just begun.</seg>
<seg id="17">As the storm blew up, he got lost and didn’t find his way back to the camp.</seg>
<seg id="18">When people came to look for the man, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn’t believe he would survive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Weathers was left to die.</seg>
<seg id="20">As if by a miracle, he still managed to find her feet and find the others.</seg>
<seg id="21">Weathers was badly frostbitten, so they still though he was dying, and once again he was left to his own devices.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is obvious that against all expectations, Beck Weathers survived.</seg>
<seg id="23">At some point, also his fellow climbers began to believe in his chances to such an extent they helped him.</seg>
<seg id="24">The film features Josh Brolin as Beck Weathers,</seg>
<seg id="25">Jason Clarke as Rob Hall, and Jake Gyllenhaal as Scott Fisher.</seg>
<seg id="26">Other roles feature for example Robin Wright, Keira Knightley, and Emily Watson.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pictures and videos: A medicane flashed its powers in Greece - the sea disappeared and a street turned into a river</seg>
<seg id="2">A strong, hurricane-type autumn storm rolled to Greece from the southwest on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Mediterranean hurricane, a medicane, has been named Zorba.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Hellenic National Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to areas of Attica, Peloponnesus, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades, and Crete.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pictures taken from the area show a lot of flooding all around Greece.</seg>
<seg id="6">A video published on Twitter shows, how, instead of a street, a river caused by flooding suddenly appeared between houses in the town of Kiato located in Corinthia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another video shows a car being carried by floodwaters.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the southern part of Peloponnesus peninsula a strong wind caused rough seas.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructed people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="10">The embassy urges people to follow weather forecasts and local officials’ instructions.</seg>
<seg id="11">A mediterranian hurricane, also known as a medicane, brings about torrential rains and even a threat of flooding.</seg>
<seg id="12">CNN reports that according to a study published in 2011, only about 1-2 medicanes occur per year, typically during the months of September and October, when sea surface temperatures are still quite warm.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current storm triggered flash flooding across Tunisia and Libya before moving north over the Mediterranean towards Europe.</seg>
<seg id="14">A cause for concern in Greece are the refugee camps on islands, like on Lesbos.</seg>
<seg id="15">The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited possibilities of finding proper protection.</seg>
<seg id="16">Also the areas destroyed by last summer's wildfires near Athens are under threat.</seg>
<seg id="17">A medicane raged in Greece also in last November.</seg>

<seg id="1">No going offshore, the flights still on schedule - there are currently thousands of Finns holidaying in the Greek islands threatened by an autumn gale.</seg>
<seg id="2">All offshore tours are cancelled, and one should be careful also when walking, so that branches or other loose objects flying in the storm do not hit one.</seg>
<seg id="3">During the weekend, the guides distributed these kinds of instructions for the about 3,500 Finns holidaying in Greek via Aurinkomatkat.</seg>
<seg id="4">The instructions are needed, because according to the forecast, it is possible that the Zorba storm battering the Greek islands this weekend can reach even a hurricane level.</seg>
<seg id="5">For example, near the island of Crete, the wind velocity in gusts can rise even up to 45 metres per second.</seg>
<seg id="6">The rottenness of the weather is made worse by torrential rains.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to tour operators, all the people who have given their phone numbers and have travelled with Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finland to Greece, have been warned about the strong winds with a text message.</seg>
<seg id="8">Still sunny and warm</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Aurinkomatkat Deputy Communications Manager Inka Ikonen, by Saturday early evening, the holiday resorts have managed to avoid the worst.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the flights have landed and took off according to normal schedule.</seg>
<seg id="11">Naturally we are constantly following the situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Safety comes first.</seg>
<seg id="13">Tui’s Emergency Phone Duty Officer Antonia Schroderus says also their flights have ran on schedule.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are constantly in contact with our staff in the resort.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was still peaceful at least in Crete, she said early on Saturday evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tui has currently a little over 1,500 Finnish travellers located in the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.</seg>
<seg id="17">Additionally, there are some a few hundred travellers staying in smaller locations.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, the worst storm will most likely reach the island of Kos on Sunday morning.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the same time, Rhodes even saw a bit of sun on Saturday afternoon, and the temperature rose to 27 degrees, says Ikonen from Aurinkomatkat.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is estimated that Zorba will continue to trouble Turkey next, even though it will be slightly eased off.</seg>
<seg id="21">To prepare for this, we have already contacted our staff in Turkey, and for example checked the number of Finns who have flown to Antalya with Tui, Schroderus says.</seg>

<seg id="2">Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (National Coalition) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to observe the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.</seg>
<seg id="3">This year, it has been decided that Finland will receive 530 Syrians from Turkis refugee camps.</seg>
<seg id="4">The selection trips are usually done a couple of times per year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, and the Police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Currently the delegation is already in Turkey, conducting interviews.</seg>
<seg id="6">The United Nations’ High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR first selects people who are in an especially vulnerable situation as candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">In practice, this means people who are considered to be in an exceptional distress, such as single parent families, handicapped and sick persons, women and children.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are more people selected to the group arriving in Finland than the quota requires, since in practice some of them will not arrive for different reasons.</seg>
<seg id="9">While in Turkey, Minister Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Minister of the Interior, Süleyman Soylu, and non-governmental organisations operating on the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="10">Minister Mykkänen will be accompanied by Permanent Secretary Ilkka Salmi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Talks about additional quota</seg>
<seg id="12">Finland has been admitting quota refugees since the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Really going off the track now - it’s impossible to know whether to laugh or cry</seg>
<seg id="2">Last Saturday Karjalainen reported on the legislative proposal to amend the Animal Welfare Act.</seg>
<seg id="3">The article gives an idea that to start with, the proposal prohibits all such animals that have not been separately permitted with a ministerial decree to be kept as farmed animals, pets, or in other way related to business operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">So to start with, everything else is prohibited except the animals that are individually mentioned in the act.</seg>
<seg id="5">If the proposal ends up as an act, this most likely means we are abandoning a common principle in western democracies that an act separately forbids an action that endangers the safety of society or good practices.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now the proposed provisions essentially forbid all such activities that the act or decrees don't separately permit.</seg>
<seg id="7">The change will result in a situation where nothing new can be tried in for example business, and no other things can be done before an approving act has been adopted or a decree issued.</seg>
<seg id="8">The government’s actions in bill drafting in general have been weak.</seg>
<seg id="9">If we now go down the road that leads to a Finland where everything is forbidden that is not separately permitted, I don’t know any more whether to laugh or cry.</seg>
<seg id="10">I don't doubt that the Animal Welfare Act needs an update.</seg>
<seg id="11">But statute drafting in this direction is not a part of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Unfortunately I don't know the Constitution all that well, but I wonder whether it permits this kind of ‘everything is forbidden if it's not separately permitted in an act or a decree’ procedure.</seg>
<seg id="13">I wish there would be a sensible minister to stop the progression of statute drafting of this kind.</seg>

<seg id="9">Be bold when combining different colours and play with the check pattern also by using tops of different patterns.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen had to admit that the worst rival Mercedes was too tough in the Russian GP qualifying.</seg>
<seg id="3">There’s no reason for panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimated.</seg>
<seg id="4">They just were faster than us, but it's not a huge thing.</seg>
<seg id="5">So far our car in the qualifying was the best thing the whole weekend, but they just were too fast, said Räikkönen, who finished fourth and, together with his team mate Sebastian Vettel, was clearly slower than Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ferrari had difficulties already in the previous race in Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="8">They seem to go faster than us - that's how simple it is.</seg>
<seg id="9">If I knew the reason for that, we’d probably go as fast as they are going.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, I don't know anymore than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is constant guesswork, and they appear to be in the lead now.</seg>
<seg id="12">Who knows why?</seg>
<seg id="13">Räikkönen’s future team, Sauber, had a rare treat in the qualifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charles Leclerc, who replaces Räikkönen at Ferrari next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also managed to make it to the final qualifying session.</seg>
<seg id="15">The tenth position is the best one the Swedish driver has had in over three years.</seg>
<seg id="16">And even if there were as many as five drivers not participating in the second session, the end result was still delicious for Sauber.</seg>
<seg id="17">And perhaps encouraging for Räikkönen, considering the next season.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yes, if you compare to where they were in the beginning of the season, the step forward has been a huge one.</seg>

<seg id="2">What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney University researchers analysed the matter, and outlined two types of ‘coolness’ consisting of slightly different characteristics: generally attractive coolness and its partial counterpart, dissident coolness.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to researchers, attractively cool people had many socially desired characteristics: they were extroverted, friendly, conciliatory, and competent.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dissidents, on the other hand, were typically distant, independent, rebellious, and had an edge to their personality.</seg>
<seg id="6">They craved for experiences and cared little for outsiders’ evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Both types had good self-esteem and steady emotional life in common.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tough role is not cool in the long run: high status during teenage years does not necessarily lead to success later in life.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is reported in an American study published in Child Development journal in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="10">Young people who started dating early, partied, gravitated towards good-looking groups, and wanted to be popular, as young adults had a bigger risk of substance use and straying into crime.</seg>
<seg id="11">They managed their relationships worse than their once more unnoticeable peers.</seg>
<seg id="12">Luxury cars, designer bags or watches signifying high status do not make a person cool - or at least not genuinely attractive company.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a research published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most of the people were more willing to befriend a person dressed in a high-street shirt than in a designer label shirt - even though most people chose to wear a designer shirt for the introductory situation.</seg>

<seg id="9">It's not easy to overtake at Sochi circuit, so the start plays an especially large role.</seg>

<seg id="14">Lewis’ lead to Sebastian Vettel is quite big, and the gap between him and me is very big, so I have to bear that in mind.</seg>

<seg id="4">That is when Kavanaugh, nominated by Donald Trump, and Californian professor Blasey Ford, who accuses him of harassment, appeared in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to preliminary results, the six main channels ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC, and NBC had a total of 20.4 million viewers during the hearing broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, there were several million following the hearing online.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to NBC, 6.8 million people followed their live stream, and CNN reported its record of the year with 8.2 million live broadcast launches.</seg>
<seg id="8">CNN number rises to over 10 million, when people following the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook are counted in.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also Fox News Digital reached 8.0 million launches.</seg>
<seg id="10">Digital launches are reported by the channels themselves, TV viewer numbers come from research and data analysis company Nielsen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nielsen publishes the final numbers on Monday, but they are anyway going to be huge.</seg>
<seg id="12">20 million viewers reached by few</seg>
<seg id="13">Normally viewer ratings of over 20 million are reached only by sports matches, big Oscar and Emmy galas of the entertainment world, and occasional political events such as presidential speeches, and, in 2016, also presidential election debates.</seg>
<seg id="14">The annual most viewed show of the United States, NFL final match Super Bowl is still far away, though.</seg>
<seg id="15">This year, Super Bowl on NBC channel gathered about 103 million people in front of their screens.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Nielsen, last year Trump's first speech to the Congress was watched by a total of nearly 48 million people, and his inauguration by more than 30 million people.</seg>
<seg id="17">Matter of top importance</seg>
<seg id="18">Appointment as a justice to the Supreme Court is an extremely significant occasion, since it is a lifetime tenure.</seg>
<seg id="19">Trump already got to appoint one new justice, when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016, and the Republicans managed to stop the then president Barack Obama from appointing his follower.</seg>
<seg id="20">Another place became open when judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year he is going to retire.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kennedy was appointed by the Republican President Ronald Reagan, but in many questions he was the so-called swing vote, who could decide the position of the court of nine.</seg>
<seg id="22">He supported abortion rights and rights of the sexual minorities, and his vote was decisive in 2015, when gay couples nationwide received a right to marry.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kavanaugh is considerably more conservative in his views.</seg>
<seg id="24">His appointment to the Supreme Court may secure the Conservative dominance for decades.</seg>

<seg id="1">Children have a right to let their parents see their information</seg>
<seg id="2">Only the parents of children under 10 years see their children's health information in the Kanta service.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a big problem, it is wrong, and it is odd.</seg>
<seg id="4">Originally the situation in the Kanta service was even more worrying: the parents could not see the babies’ medical records or prescriptions.</seg>
<seg id="5">In autumn 2016, the situation was fixed for under the 10-year-olds with an amendment described as temporary</seg>
<seg id="6">After that, there have been promises to fix the practices, but the fixing has taken astonishingly long.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now a fix is on the way - in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since the problem is an explicit one, changing the law basis should not have been anything more than an open-and-shut case.</seg>
<seg id="9">After that, according to a layperson’s understanding, it is simply about pressing a button: now the wire is closed, so let's open it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Naturally a child can show their information to the parents - if the child has banking user identifiers or an official identity card.</seg>
<seg id="11">But how many 10-year-olds have those?</seg>
<seg id="12">An identity card is not free, and a 10-year-old can’t even get banking identifiers.</seg>
<seg id="13">So basically it is impossible for anyone to see a primary school fourth-former’s records without asking them to be printed out.</seg>
<seg id="14">It’s not that much about the parents’ rights than about the children’s rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is essential to a child’s care that parents can be involved.</seg>
<seg id="16">Obviously it's important to take care of the teenager’s right to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even minors can have family situations, where not all things can be freely discussed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Often they are related to sexual health, and taking care of it freely is a deeply meaningful human right.</seg>

<seg id="2">United Nations Children’s Fund UNICEF and other international humanitarian organisations are prepared to help at Indonesian island of Sulawesi, recounts Kirsi Haru, Chief of Communication at UNICEF Finland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The local authorities are in charge of the rescue operations, but the need for extra help is apparent already in this stage.</seg>
<seg id="4">UNICEF operates in nearly every country, and we have long-term projects also in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="5">UNICEF always has a complete emergency help preparedness, in addition to its normal operations, Haru says.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first task now is to find the people from the ruins, both the living and the dead.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the Sulawesi city of Palu, the rescue operations are ongoin, but a bit norther in the area of Donggala, the situation is less clear.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are still places, where communications do not work.</seg>
<seg id="9">Relief actions are difficult, because also the roads are blocked, Haru states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Buildings on Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the destruction caused by the earthquake and tsunami are great.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the survivors have been found, they need shelter - in the beginning for example tents - and clean water.</seg>
<seg id="12">In crisis situations, clean water is the most urgent thing.</seg>
<seg id="13">First thing we can generally offer to people are water purification tablets that also UNICEF has in stock.</seg>
<seg id="14">The goal is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in emergency situations, water is transported with for example trucks.</seg>
<seg id="15">In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.</seg>
<seg id="16">Finding the family members and reuniting families is one part of the Unicef duties.</seg>
<seg id="17">Food assistance is organised by, among others, WFP (World Food Programme), which works as a branch of UN.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the first stage, previously raised funds are used for emergency help.</seg>
<seg id="19">Unicef, among others, has however already began to raise funds to help the victims of the earth quake and tsunami in Indonesia.</seg>

<seg id="2">Elon Musk, founder of companies manufacturing space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges with a deal with the United States’ Securities and Exchange Commission.</seg>
<seg id="3">Billionaire Elon Musk quits as electric car company Tesla's Chairman of the Board and agrees to a 20 million dollar fine.</seg>
<seg id="4">Musk steps down as part of a deal he made with the authority regulating the United States’ securities industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">With this deal Musk avoids fraud charges.</seg>
<seg id="6">The United States’ Securities and Exchange Commission SEC threatened musk with a security fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.</seg>
<seg id="7">In these tweets, Musk wrote he is preparing to take electric car company Tesla private, which resulted in a quick rise in the company's share price.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the deal, Musk is not allowed to act as Tesla chairman of the board for three years.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, Tesla must nominate a new “independent member” to its board and take two “independent managers” to its management group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tesla also has to found a committee to supervise Musk’s communications.</seg>
<seg id="11">Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla CEO.</seg>
<seg id="12">On top of Musk's personal 20 million dollar fine, Tesla as a company also has to pay an equivalent 20 million fine to the Commission.</seg>
<seg id="13">Tweets misled investors</seg>
<seg id="14">According to SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="15">Musk claimed to have secured funding to repurchase Tesla from the stock market to a private company.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought out from the stock market with a stock price of 420 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="17">After the tweets, Tesla’s stock price rose over ten per cent in twenty-four hours, but later fell.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to SEC, Tesla's claims had no basis of any kind.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the Commission, in reality he had not negotiated the funding he claimed to have.</seg>
<seg id="20">Neither had he discussed withdrawing the company from the market with other members of the managing group or the company board.</seg>
<seg id="21">Friday this week, the price decreased 14 per cent, as SEC published the fraud charge.</seg>
<seg id="22">The news about settlement are expected to again re-enforce the company's stock price.</seg>
