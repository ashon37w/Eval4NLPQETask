        <seg id="2">乡村振兴，人才是关键。</seg>
        <seg id="3">人才哪里找？</seg>
        <seg id="4">优秀返乡农民工群体是不可或缺的生力军。</seg>
        <seg id="5">新华社发 商海春 作</seg>
        <seg id="6">新华社成都7月26日电 题：把优秀返乡农民工打造成乡村振兴生力军</seg>
        <seg id="7">今年34岁的张雄家在四川眉山市果园村，2010年他辞掉北京月薪上万的工作返乡创业。</seg>
        <seg id="8">经过几年打拼，如今他经营的葡萄种植家庭农场年收入超过百万元，成为小有名气的致富带头人，还被选拔进入村“两委”班子。</seg>
        <seg id="9">近年来，在国家脱贫攻坚、乡村振兴等一系列支农惠农政策激励感召下，越来越多像张雄一样的优秀农民工选择返乡创业，激活了乡村一池春水。</seg>
        <seg id="10">我国西部人口大省、劳务输出大省四川，因势利导实施“优秀农民工回引培养工程”，仅2019年，就从回引的优秀农民工中产生村党支部书记8000余名，培育村后备力量6.1万名，发展党员2万余名，为打赢脱贫攻坚战和实施乡村振兴战略提供有力保证。</seg>
        <seg id="11">小康不小康，关键看老乡。</seg>
        <seg id="12">改革开放以来，我国农村大量青壮年劳动力外出务工增收，有的通过打拼创办了自己的企业。</seg>
        <seg id="13">但客观上也导致农村“空心化”不同程度地出现，特别是农村基层组织弱化，村党支部书记和党员队伍均呈现出“一老一低”特征，即年龄老化、学历偏低，村党组织带头人队伍不强、青黄不接问题突出。</seg>
        <seg id="14">如果乡村人才等要素一直单向流往城市，乡村长期处于“失血” “贫血”状态，振兴就是一句空话。</seg>
        <seg id="15">把那些有能力、有觉悟、有志于为家乡服务的农民工吸引回来，引导他们返乡创业成为致富带头人，从中择优培养成党员、乡村干部，充实基层干部队伍，这是解决农村党员队伍和基层党组织青黄不接的治本之策。</seg>
        <seg id="16">优秀农民工引得回，还要让他们留得住、干得好。</seg>
        <seg id="17">近年来，四川从狠抓农民工党建入手，在严格人选标准的基础上，建立优秀农民工定向回引、服务保障、培训提能、选拔使用等制度机制，让他们在能力上有提升、工作上有保障、生活上有盼头，真正在农村扎下根，干事创业有成就感。</seg>
        <seg id="18">今年是决战脱贫攻坚的收官之年，做好脱贫攻坚与乡村振兴的衔接，人才是关键因素。</seg>
        <seg id="19">各级党委政府要高度重视优秀返乡农民工这一群体，通过综合措施，把他们打造成一支留得住、能战斗、带不走的工作队、生力军，为农村脱贫奔小康和发展振兴提供强有力的组织保障和人才支撑。</seg>

        <seg id="2">Talent is the key to rural revitalization.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Where is talent found?</seg>
        <seg id="4">Outstanding returning rural migrant workers are an indispensable force in the fight.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Published by Xinhua News Agency Author: Shang Haichun</seg>
        <seg id="6">Xinhua News Agency, reported July 26th Headline: Outstanding returning rural migrant workers can be a force for rural revitalization - Xinhuanet</seg>
        <seg id="7">Zhang Xiong, age 34, is a resident of Guoyuan Village in Meishan City, Sichuan Province who quit his job with a salary over 10,000 yuan in Beijing and returned to his hometown to start a business in 2010.</seg>
        <seg id="8">After a few years of effort, his family’s vinery now earns an annual income of over a million yuan, he has gained a small amount of fame for being a wealth creator, and he has also been selected as a member of the village’s “Two Committees”.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In recent years, national policies to alleviate poverty, revitalize rural areas, and benefit farmers and agriculture have inspired an increasing number of people outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong to return to their hometowns to start their own businesses, which has become a new source of growth for rural areas.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Sichuan is a western Chinese province with a large population and that produces high labor outflows, but thanks to the province’s “Outstanding Rural Migrant Worker Return Incentives and Cultivation Project”, in 2019 alone, the program has produced more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries from returned outstanding rural migrant workers, brought back and cultivated a labor force of 61,000 for villages, and produced over 20,000 new Party members, creating a powerful guarantee in the fight to eliminate poverty and implement rural revitalization strategies.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Hometowns are the key to moderate prosperity.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Since reform and opening up, huge numbers of young in China have left rural villages to seek work elsewhere, and some, through their own hard work, have managed to start their own companies.</seg>
        <seg id="13">But objectively speaking, to varying degrees, it has also led to the “hollowing out” of Chinese villages, especially those where grassroots organizations are weak, and led to the “aging and lowering” phenomenon among village Party branch secretaries and cadres, in which these groups are both getting older and have lower educational attainment, leading to disinterest among young people in continuing the work of village Party organizations with weak leadership.</seg>
        <seg id="14">If rural talent and other assets only flow in one direction, to the cities, in the long term this leads to “loss of blood” and “anemia” in rural areas, in turn making “revitalization” an empty slogan.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Attracting back migrant workers who are capable, conscientious, and determined to serve their hometowns, incentivizing them to return there to start businesses and become wealth creators, and then cultivating them as Party members and rural cadres to enrich the ranks of grassroots cadres is a permanent solution to the problem of young people not continuing the work of rural Party corps and grassroots Party organizations.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Once outstanding rural migrant workers return, they also must be convinced to stay and do good work.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In recent years, Sichuan has focused more on Party-building among rural migrant workers, and on the basis of strict selection requirements, has established systems and mechanisms such as directed incentives for outstanding rural migrant workers to return, service guarantees, training and promotion, and selection and use which ensure they will gain from their effort, receive guarantees in their work, have things to look forward to in life, truly put down roots in the village, and feel a sense of accomplishment in their work and entrepreneurship.</seg>
        <seg id="18">This is the final year of the battle to decisively end poverty, and talent is the key factor to establish the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Party committees and governments at every level should prioritize rural migrant workers who return to their hometowns, and should use comprehensive measures to form them into a work corps and army that is willing to stay, capable of contributing, and unwilling to leave, so that they can serve as a powerful organizational guarantee and talent pool that supports rural poverty elimination and prosperity building efforts, as well as rural development and revitalization.</seg>

        <seg id="4">北京野生动物已达500余种</seg>
        <seg id="5">本报讯(记者 王斌)北京青年报记者从市园林绿化局获悉，近年来随着首都自然生态环境的持续向好，野生动物的种类和数量也随之持续增加。</seg>
        <seg id="6">目前，栖息北京的陆生脊椎野生动物已增加至500余种，包括褐马鸡、黑鹳等国家一级保护动物，以及斑羚、大天鹅、灰鹤、鸳鸯等国家二级保护动物。</seg>
        <seg id="7">无论是种进二环内的一处处城市森林，还是嵌入楼宇之间的小微湿地，不仅为首都市民带来了大自然的野趣，也吸引着野生动物到城市里“定居 ” 。</seg>
        <seg id="8">盛夏时节，位于延庆区西北部燕山山脉中的松山国家级自然保护区内一派生机勃勃。</seg>
        <seg id="9">一只貉在山涧旁悠闲玩耍，一旁，两只狗獾互相打闹起来。</seg>
        <seg id="10">回过头来，一只野猪忍不住身上的“刺挠”，正使劲蹭着树皮。松山国家级自然保护区管理处主任胡巧立介绍，截至2019年底，在这片总面积超过6200公顷的绿海中，生活着包括国家一级保护动物金雕和国家二级保护动物勺鸡、斑羚在内的178种野生动物，全市近三分之一的野生动物种类都能在这里见到踪迹。</seg>
        <seg id="11">“在松山，野生动物是真正的‘主人’，我们工作人员充其量只能算是人家的‘保镖’。”</seg>
        <seg id="12">胡巧立说，为了实地了解保护区内野生动植物的情况，每天都有30多名专业巡护队员，沿着16条精心制定的保护路线巡查，每个月还会有一趟“转大圈”，用一整天的时间几乎走遍整个保护区。</seg>
        <seg id="13">“在巡查时，不光要检查记录生物多样性情况，还要检查安装人工鸟巢，救护受伤的野生动物，安装野外红外相机等等。”</seg>
        <seg id="14">松山国家级自然保护区现已安装200余台红外相机，记录下林中野生动物的生活状态。</seg>
        <seg id="15">胡巧立介绍，随着这几年保护区生物多样性不断丰富，越来越多的野生动物出现在镜头之中，豹猫、貉和猪獾已经成为“常驻嘉宾”，国家二级保护动物斑羚的“出镜率”也越来越高。</seg>
        <seg id="16">北京市园林绿化局野生动植物和湿地保护处处长张志明介绍，北京陆生脊椎野生动物已从1994年的461种，增加到现在的500多种，北京的野生动物种类和数量近年来持续增加。</seg>
        <seg id="17">城市中野生动物的身影越发常见，与近年来首都城市绿化不断升级密切相关。</seg>
        <seg id="18">特别是2018年开始的新一轮百万亩造林绿化建设，提出要重塑城市生态环境，提升林地绿地的生态功能，突出“近自然”理念。</seg>
        <seg id="19">规划上力求与周边绿地实现互联互动，方便野生动物“走亲访友”，种的树也都是动物们喜爱的蜜源、食源植物。</seg>

        <seg id="2">2020-07-26 05:03:17 Source: Beijing Youth Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo</seg>
        <seg id="3">Natural ecology in Beijing continues to improve, attracting wildlife to "settle" in the city</seg>
        <seg id="4">Beijing now has more than 500 species of wild animals.</seg>
        <seg id="5">(Reporter Wang Bin) The Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau that in recent years, as the natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, the species and number of wild animals had also continued to increase.</seg>
        <seg id="6">At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife inhabiting Beijing exceeds 500, including national first-level protected animals such as the brown-eared pheasant and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as the goral, whooper swan, grey crane and mandarin duck.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Whether urban forests planted within the Second Ring Road or a small wetland embedded between buildings, it not only brings nature's rustic charm to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.</seg>
        <seg id="8">In the summer, the Songshan Nature Reserve in the Yanshan Mountains in the north-west of Yanqing District is full of life.</seg>
        <seg id="9">A raccoon dog is playing by a creek, while two badgers are playing with each other nearby.</seg>
        <seg id="10">When looking back, you can see that a wild boar, unable to resist the "itch" on its body, is rubbing against a tree. Hu Qiaoli, Director of the Songshan Nature Reserve Management Office, said that by the end of 2019, 178 species of wildlife, including the golden eagle, a national first-level protected animal, as well as the koklass pheasant and gazelles, national second-level protected animals, have been living in this green zone with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, and nearly a third of wildlife species in Beijing could be found here.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"Here in Songshan, wild animals are the real 'owners' and our staff can at best be thought of as their 'bodyguards'. ”</seg>
        <seg id="12">Hu Qiaoli said, in order to understand the situation of wildlife in the reserve, more than 30 professional patrol members patrol along 16 specifically developed protection routes every day, and every month there is a major one-day round trip for them to walk through almost the entire reserve.</seg>
        <seg id="13">"During the patrols, they not only check and record the biodiversity, but also the conditions of artificial bird nests, in addition to rescuing injured wildlife, installing infrared cameras in the field, and so on. ”</seg>
        <seg id="14">Now, the Songshan Nature Reserve has more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Hu Qiaoli said that as the reserve's biodiversity has improved over the past few years, more and more wild animals have appeared on camera, with leopard cats, raccoons dogs, and hog-nosed badgers becoming "regular guests"; meanwhile, the goral, a national second-level protected animal, has been captured even more frequently.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Zhang Zhiming, Director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Department of the Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species today, and that the number of wildlife species in Beijing has continued to increase in recent years.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The increasingly common presence of wildlife in the city is closely related to the continuous upgrading of urban greening in Beijing in recent years.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In particular, the new round of One Million Mu of forestation and greening construction, which began in 2018, intends to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological functions of woodlands and greenbelts, and highlight the concept of being "close-to-nature".</seg>
        <seg id="19">The plan aims to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding greenbelts, so that wild animals can easily "visit their relatives and friends", and the trees planted are nectar and food source plants that these animals love.</seg>

        <seg id="21">那是因为人们谈论自己的经历时， 倾向于分享积极的图像。</seg>
        <seg id="22">你上次在葬礼上看到自拍照 是什么时候？</seg>
        <seg id="23">我意识到在改进人工智能的过程中， 是任务归任务，数据集归数据集， 在电脑的理解上， 创造出巨大的差距，缺陷和盲点。</seg>
        <seg id="24">在这样做的同时， 我正在为各种偏见编码。</seg>

        <seg id="27">而同样的偏差，那个盲点 继续带入了 90 年代。</seg>
        <seg id="28">同样的盲点即使在今天， 仍然存在于在面部识别技术应用中， 怎样辨识不同人物的脸。</seg>
        <seg id="29">在今天的研究中， 我想到了最先进的技术， 都倾向于将我们的想法， 限制在一个数据集和一个问题上。</seg>
        <seg id="30">而这样做，我们正在创造 更多的盲点和偏见， 会在使用人工智能时 被进一步放大。</seg>
        <seg id="31">那时我意识到我们必须深思， 我们今天发明创造技术， 在五年到十年之后会怎样被看待 。</seg>

        <seg id="33">人工智能相比之下，正在以 令人难以置信的速度发展。</seg>
        <seg id="34">这意味着它确实很重要， 我们现在要仔细考虑这一点 —— 反思自己的盲点， 及偏见， 并考虑这些偏见是如何影响 我们现在创造的技术， 并讨论今天的技术， 对未来意味着什么。</seg>
        <seg id="35">CEO和科学家， 已经权衡了他们的想法， 关于未来的人工智能发展。</seg>

        <seg id="1">I work on helping computers communicate about the world around us.</seg>
        <seg id="2">There are a lot of ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Given a scene like this, a modern computer-vision algorithm can tell you that there's a woman and there's a dog.</seg>
        <seg id="4">It can tell you that the woman is smiling.</seg>
        <seg id="5">It might even be able to tell you that the dog is incredibly cute.</seg>
        <seg id="6">I work on this problem thinking about how humans understand and process the world.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The thoughts, memories and stories that a scene like this might evoke for humans.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All the interconnections of related situations.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Maybe you've seen a dog like this one before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this one, and that further evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, past times to the beach, times spent running around with other dogs.</seg>
        <seg id="10">One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers to understand what it's like to have these experiences, to understand what we share and believe and feel, then we're in a great position to start evolving computer technology in a way that's complementary with our own experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="11">So, digging more deeply into this, a few years ago I began working on helping computers to generate human-like stories from sequences of images.</seg>
        <seg id="12">So, one day, I was working with my computer to ask it what it thought about a trip to Australia.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It took a look at the pictures, and it saw a koala.</seg>
        <seg id="14">It didn't know what the koala was, but it said it thought it was an interesting-looking creature.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Then I shared with it a sequence of images about a house burning down.</seg>
        <seg id="16">It took a look at the images and it said, "This is an amazing view! This is spectacular!"</seg>
        <seg id="17">It sent chills down my spine.</seg>
        <seg id="18">It saw a horrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.</seg>
        <seg id="19">I realized that it recognized the contrast, the reds, the yellows, and thought it was something worth remarking on positively.</seg>
        <seg id="20">And part of why it was doing this was because most of the images I had given it were positive images.</seg>
        <seg id="21">That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="22">When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?</seg>
        <seg id="23">I realized that, as I worked on improving AI task by task, dataset by dataset, that I was creating massive gaps, holes and blind spots in what it could understand.</seg>
        <seg id="24">And while doing so, I was encoding all kinds of biases.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint, limited to a single dataset -- biases that can reflect human biases found in the data, such as prejudice and stereotyping.</seg>
        <seg id="26">I thought back to the evolution of the technology that brought me to where I was that day -- how the first color images were calibrated against a white woman's skin, meaning that color photography was biased against black faces.</seg>
        <seg id="27">And that same bias, that same blind spot continued well into the '90s.</seg>
        <seg id="28">And the same blind spot continues even today in how well we can recognize different people's faces in facial recognition technology.</seg>
        <seg id="29">I though about the state of the art in research today, where we tend to limit our thinking to one dataset and one problem.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And that in doing so, we were creating more blind spots and biases that the AI could further amplify.</seg>
        <seg id="31">I realized then that we had to think deeply about how the technology we work on today looks in five years, in 10 years.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Humans evolve slowly, with time to correct for issues in the interaction of humans and their environment.</seg>
        <seg id="33">In contrast, artificial intelligence is evolving at an incredibly fast rate.</seg>
        <seg id="34">And that means that it really matters that we think about this carefully right now -- that we reflect on our own blind spots, our own biases, and think about how that's informing the technology we're creating and discuss what the technology of today will mean for tomorrow.</seg>
        <seg id="35">CEOs and scientists have weighed in on what they think the artificial intelligence technology of the future will be.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Stephen Hawking warns that "Artificial intelligence could end mankind."</seg>
        <seg id="37">Elon Musk warns that it's an existential risk and one of the greatest risks that we face as a civilization.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Bill Gates has made the point, "I don't understand why people aren't more concerned."</seg>
        <seg id="39">But these views -- they're part of the story.</seg>
        <seg id="40">The math, the models, the basic building blocks of artificial intelligence are something that we call access and all work with.</seg>
        <seg id="41">We have open-source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we can contribute to.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And beyond that, we can share our experience.</seg>
        <seg id="43">We can share our experiences with technology and how it concerns us and how it excites us.</seg>
        <seg id="44">We can discuss what we love.</seg>
        <seg id="45">We can communicate with foresight about the aspects of technology that could be more beneficial or could be more problematic over time.</seg>
        <seg id="46">If we all focus on opening up the discussion on AI with foresight towards the future, this will help create a general conversation and awareness about what AI is now, what it can become and all the things that we need to do in order to enable that outcome that best suits us.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We already see and know this in the technology that we use today.</seg>
        <seg id="48">We use smart phones and digital assistants and Roombas.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Are they evil?</seg>
        <seg id="50">Maybe sometimes.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Are they beneficial?</seg>
        <seg id="52">Yes, they're that, too.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And they're not all the same.</seg>
        <seg id="54">And there you already see a light shining on what the future holds.</seg>
        <seg id="55">The future continues on from what we build and create right now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">We set into motion that domino effect that carves out AI's evolutionary path.</seg>
        <seg id="57">In our time right now, we shape the AI of tomorrow.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Technology that immerses us in augmented realities bringing to life past worlds.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Technology that helps people to share their experiences when they have difficulty communicating.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Technology built on understanding the streaming visual worlds used as technology for self-driving cars.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Technology built on understanding images and generating language, evolving into technology that helps people who are visually impaired be better able to access the visual world.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And we also see how technology can lead to problems.</seg>
        <seg id="63">We have technology today that analyzes physical characteristics we're born with -- such as the color of our skin or the look of our face -- in order to determine whether or not we might be criminals or terrorists.</seg>
        <seg id="64">We have technology that crunches through our data, even data relating to our gender or our race, in order to determine whether or not we might get a loan.</seg>
        <seg id="65">All that we see now is a snapshot in the evolution of artificial intelligence.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Because where we are right now, is within a moment of that evolution.</seg>
        <seg id="67">That means that what we do now will affect what happens down the line and in the future.</seg>
        <seg id="68">If we want AI to evolve in a way that helps humans, then we need to define the goals and strategies that enable that path now.</seg>
        <seg id="69">What I'd like to see is something that fits well with humans, with our culture and with the environment.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Technology that aids and assists those of us with neurological conditions or other disabilities in order to make life equally challenging for everyone.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Technology that works regardless of your demographics or the color of your skin.</seg>
        <seg id="72">And so today, what I focus on is the technology for tomorrow and for 10 years from now.</seg>
        <seg id="73">AI can turn out in many different ways.</seg>
        <seg id="74">But in this case, it isn't a self-driving car without any destination.</seg>
        <seg id="75">This is the car that we are driving.</seg>
        <seg id="76">We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.</seg>
        <seg id="77">We choose if we need to make a turn.</seg>
        <seg id="78">We choose what the AI of the future will be.</seg>
        <seg id="79">There's a vast playing field of all the things that artificial intelligence can become.</seg>
        <seg id="80">It will become many things.</seg>
        <seg id="81">And it's up to us now, in order to figure out what we need to put in place to make sure the outcomes of artificial intelligence are the ones that will be better for all of us.</seg>
        <seg id="82">Thank you.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26th, 2020 Title: Agricultural Modernization in the Black Land</seg>
        <seg id="3">In mid-summer, two planes that spray pesticides flew above the Ten Thousand Mu High-Yield Demonstration Field of the Second Work Station, Fifth Management Area, Youyi Farm, forming two white lines, and the large characters “The World’s No.1 Farm” were extremely clear as formed by the black rice seedlings in the green field.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Kong Lingqiang, Director of the Work Station, said that such planes were able to spray pesticides over 6,000 mu (400 hectares) of fields per day, the efficiency of which was eight times unmanned aerial vehicle, and hundreds of times that of human labor.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, which is the largest grain production base of China, and judging from the swish of cutting the rice seedlings with sickles in the past to the rumble of motors today, we can see that China’s traditional agriculture and farm have changed tremendously in the black land.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Apart from planes, satellites are also used in the modernized agricultural production of Youyi Farm.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Kong Lingqiang stated that on one hand, they utilized satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization and reduce inputs in agriculture and pollution; on the other , satellite navigation technology improves the standardized work of agricultural machines in the field.</seg>
        <seg id="8">During the production of rice this year, the farm extended the area utilizing satellite navigation unmanned driving transplantation technology to 30,000 mu (2,000 hectares) from 3,000 mu (200 hectares) last year.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Such technology enables more even transplantation of rice seedlings, which maximizes the use of sunlight and arable fields, saving RMB 16 on human labor per mu on average.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The attempt to use new information technologies and intelligent technologies in the farm’s agricultural production is the largest agricultural machine group in China.</seg>
        <seg id="11">According to statistics, there are 49,000 agricultural machines held by the farms at present, and the overall mechanization rate is 99.8%.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The rates of using GPS satellite navigation for agricultural machines, accurate sowing in dry land, and using machines with high horsepower on dry land are all 100%.</seg>
        <seg id="13">“Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the directions of exploration in agricultural modernization, ”</seg>
        <seg id="14">Liu Hualian, President of Youyi Farm, said.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The key to agricultural modernization is scientific and technological advancements.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation Bureau, on behalf of the farms it represents, has fully acted as the “aircraft carrier” of modernized agriculture in recent years, and has firstly built a modern agricultural system characterized by scaled planting, standardized production, and industrialized operation.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In the suburb of Youyi County, there is an agricultural machine exhibition park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.</seg>
        <seg id="18">It exhibits more than 140 agricultural machines and tools introduced and used by the Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation Bureau over the past years.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Those agricultural machines, tools, and farms bear witness the modernization process of Chinese agriculture.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Edited by Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu and Liu Xiacun</seg>
        <seg id="4">At 4 p.m. on July 25th, Fu Kunbao wore a pair of rubber boots which were covered with mud as he walked from the front room to the back, scurrying to pack items with his wife Zhou Yan.</seg>
        <seg id="5">“When we got the call asking us to relocated from our village cadres, I was cutting the grass in the field. ”</seg>
        <seg id="6">Fu Kunbao said that he rented over 60 mu field to plant rice, the growth of which was healthy, “I just sprayed the pesticide yesterday, the tools were even not packed. ”</seg>
        <seg id="7">Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer in the corner, “No one wants his home to be lost in a flood, but we have to sacrifice our own interests for the public good. ”</seg>
        <seg id="8">To cope with the continuous high water levels at Chaohu Lake and the possible strong downpour, Hefei City is preparing to use a joint embankment at Jiangkou River, where Fu Kunbao’s home is located, to diverge the flood and save water.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The joint embankment of Jiangkou River is located in Feixi County, which is close to the bank of Chaohu Lake.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Thousands of villagers in Yandian Village and Sanhe Town will be relocated.</seg>
        <seg id="11">By 16:00 on July 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, was still 13.2 meters, 0.7 meter higher than the safety level.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The kitchen of Fu Kunbao’s home was neat, with a bowl of pumpkin dishes on the table, and some eggs and vegetables in sauce in the fridge.</seg>
        <seg id="13">“I never thought I’d have to move away, and the current water level of Jiangkou River looks safe. ”</seg>
        <seg id="14">Zhou Yan said that her house is a bungalow, and she hasn’t found a suitable place to store the large items for now.</seg>
        <seg id="15">“I can pack expensive and important items first, and the large items like the fridge and television can be placed at a neighbor’s or relative’s house which is at a higher elevation. ”</seg>
        <seg id="16">Wang Liwen, village cadre, helped Fu Kunbao make plans.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Wang Liwen was in charge of the relocation of 13 households, so he informed the villagers one by one, and confirmed the settlement plan with everyone.</seg>
        <seg id="18">The nearest resettlement place to Fu Kunbao’s home is Suxiao Primary School in Yandian Village, which was two kilometers away.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Apart from the large items, the over 1,000 jin (500 kg) of grain and newly bought furniture was also a headache Fu Kunbao and his wife.</seg>
        <seg id="20">“We are going to move the grain to our relative’s home, but we have no way to move the furniture. ”</seg>
        <seg id="21">After discussion, the couple placed several chairs beneath their new bed, raising it by about 0.5 meters.</seg>
        <seg id="22">At 6 p.m., Fu Kunbao began to move these items to his relative’s home by tricycle, while Zhou Yan continued to pack at home.</seg>
        <seg id="23">At 11 p.m., the couple checked everything across the home, shut down the electricity, and left for the settlement place.</seg>
        <seg id="24">“We hope that the flooding ends soon, ”</seg>
        <seg id="25">Fu Kunbao said.</seg>
        <seg id="26">At 9:30 a.m. on July 26th, this journalist saw at Jiangkou River that the local government was fully prepared to divert the flood.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The inspiring competitive show for youth sports, We Are The One, was officially broadcast on Hunan TV on July 11.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The team leader Zhang Jike and Sports Assistant Lin Xiaozhai are from different fields, but worked together, and commenters Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui were each unique in their own way, but the appearance of the hardcore “enormous” strength gin pole made the program more “exciting”.</seg>
        <seg id="4">During the first episode, 11 young athletes came to the strength arena, and their appearance stunned the audience while arousing significant attention to their “fierce conflict” “robust confrontation”, and “strong hearts”.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Among them, the “fierce conflict” was from the awe-inspiring student athlete Qiao Wenyi, who publicly provoked “handsome boy” Xu Zhibin on the same racetrack with him when he joked that Xu Zhibin should be on a singing and dancing show, insulting his competitor’s appearance, and even saying that “if you lose, don’t cry or your make-up will run”.</seg>
        <seg id="6">His words made all the young people and sports officials gasp.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The “robust confrontation” was more like a battle between masters, with “Big Devil” Sun Jianqi competing against the formidable Zhang Xindong in a stunning match.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Their identity was also surprising, with Sun Jianqi an actor who is passionate about fitness, while Zhang Xindong is a retired commando who has won military medals three times.</seg>
        <seg id="9">At the start of the match, the two pulled on the small gin pole with all their strength, and the audience was anxious to see their more intense confrontation at the large gin pole.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The atmosphere was tense as one of the hosts of the program, Zhang Jike, also watched the battle intently.</seg>
        <seg id="11">When giving commentary, he was very careful, patiently encouraging the loser and helping him review his mistakes.</seg>
        <seg id="12">But sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai was a marvelous helper, who never concealed her appreciation for these good-looking and competitive young athletes.</seg>
        <seg id="13">After learning about their over-loaded daily training, she admired them a lot.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The other team leaders, Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, were each unique in their own way, with one being a calm “predictor”, while the other was the “bubbly optimistic girl” who eased the tension with her warm smile.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As sports assistants, Jike and Liu Ye also discussed several funny topics around young athletes.</seg>

        <seg id="2">July 26 (Ecns.cn) According to reports from foreign media, on July 18, the Cathédrale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul de Nantes, a religious, historical, and architectural treasure, was seriously damaged in a fire, and the great organ was completely destroyed.</seg>
        <seg id="3">On the 26th (CET), Nantes prosecutors announced that a parochial volunteer who was responsible for the security of the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction."</seg>
        <seg id="4">The suspect has already pleaded guilty.</seg>
        <seg id="5">According to the report, the local prosecutor Cenas said that the 39-year-old parochial volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he had set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.</seg>
        <seg id="6">His lawyer said that the arsonist now regrets doing such a thing.</seg>
        <seg id="7">He entered France via an asylum claim a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire happened, and was taken in by the church.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Prosecutors noted that recently, the suspect tried to update his visa and was in the process of dialogue with the police.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But workers in the cathedral couldn’t believe that the believer, who was kind and taciturn, would destroy the church he loved so much.</seg>
        <seg id="10">On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer was questioned by police about inconsistencies in his narrative, but he was later released.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Image shows rescue by firefighters at the scene.</seg>
        <seg id="12">On the evening of the 25th, the man was again subpoenaed as a result of new evidence obtained by professional engineers of the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Station.</seg>
        <seg id="13">This time, the man admitted to his arson.</seg>
        <seg id="14">If convicted of the crime of deliberate arson and destruction, the suspect will face 10 years' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.</seg>
        <seg id="15">It was reported that the fire caused serious damage to the Cathédrale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul de Nantes: the pipe organ in the church was completely burned and the stained glass window behind the pipe organ was also seriously damaged.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Brunel, the chief architect of French Built Heritage Conservation, believes that a conservative estimate of the required cathedral restoration work would take at least three years.</seg>

        <seg id="2">BEIJING, July 26, 2020 (Xinhua, by foreign correspondents) On the morning of July 24, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China announced to the US Embassy in China its decision to withdraw its consent for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and the Ministry also made specific requirements for the cessation of all operations and events by the Consulate General.</seg>
        <seg id="3">International opinion holds the view that the unilateralism adopted by the US severely disturbs normal Sino-US relations, and China’s response to the irrational aggression of the US and its countermeasures against the US are proper and essential.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Andres Borquez, Directer of the China Research Center, Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile said that the unilateralism of the US destroyed the bridge between the people of the two countries, leading to the current crisis in Sino-US relations.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Therefore, China’s announcement of its closure of the General Consulate of the United States in Chengdu is a countermeasure against such unilateralism which conforms to the rules of foreign affairs.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Patricio Giusto, Professor of the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina and Director of China-Argentina Research Center held the view that,\ China’s decisions were proper and essential countermeasures against the aggression of the US, which was not targeted at its general public.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The US tried to conceal their bad countermeasures against COVID-19 by exerting pressure on China to shift its public attention.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Bambang Suryono, Chairman of the Asian Creative Research Center, a think-tank in Indonesia, said that the aggressive attitude of the US severely disturbs normal Sino-US relations and brings about severe challenges.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Thus, China’s announcement of its closure of the General Consulate of the United States in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure which conforms to the rules of foreign affairs and shows China’s principle and stance to firmly defend their self-interests whilst embodying its rationality and principled position, and China’s etiquette of China’s coping with foreign affairs.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Francis Semwenza, a current affairs commentator of Tanzania, said that, China’s decisions were proper and essential responses to the aggression of the US.</seg>
        <seg id="11">For the re-normalization of Sino-US relations, the US government should actively improve its relationship with China, and quit its intervention in China’s domestic affairs.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The US government should focus more on win-win situations in both economic growth and politics, as well as benefiting people of both the two countries and even the whole global community.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Ali Yousif, Executive Director of the Sudan-based Association of Arab-Chinese Friendship, said that, the countermeasures forced to be taken were proper and essential responses to the irrational behavior of the US, which conformed to the basic rules of the international law and international relations, as well as the rules of foreign affairs.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The requirement to close the General Consulate of China in Houston seriously disobeyed the basic rules of the international law and international relations.</seg>
        <seg id="15">And he hoped the US would cancel the relevant decisions and create necessary conditions for the re-normalization of Sino-US relations.</seg>
        <seg id="16">An editorial in Singapore’s Lianhe Zaobao said that the broader strategic blueprint of the US was to contain China, and prohibit its continuous rise.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In face of the increasingly tight aggression, China was unwilling to witness the continuous deterioration of Sino-US relations, but it had no other choice but to take countermeasures.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, the country's Justice Ministry said Saturday.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty violated the rights of parents by requiring schools to teach students about gender issues.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Justice Minister Ziobro said at a press conference that his ministry will submit a request on Monday to the Ministry of Labor and the Family to begin withdrawing from the treaty.</seg>
        <seg id="5">That treaty is also called the Istanbul Convention.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Ziobro said,”The treaty contains elements which we consider to be of a harmful and ideological nature ”</seg>
        <seg id="7">Law and Justice, the ruling party of Poland, and its coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Polish president Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.</seg>
        <seg id="9">On Friday, thousands of Polish people (mostly women) protested against withdrawing from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence," Lempart, one of the organizers of the protest, said during a protest march in Warsaw.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Some protesters carried banners that said "Law and Justice is women's hell."</seg>
        <seg id="12">Law and Justice has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Law and Justice says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.</seg>
        <seg id="15">But so far, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.</seg>

        <seg id="5">In order to do a good job of ecological water replenishment, the Department of Water Resources of Hebei Province actively organizes the investigation of hidden hazards, rectification and reinforcement, and river cleaning work to strengthen inspection and management with detailed and practical implementation measures.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Through supervision, inspection, and intensive &amp; secret inquiries, various problems were resolved in time to ensure the safe and smooth replenishment work.</seg>
        <seg id="7">According to the person in charge of the relevant division in the Department of Water Resources of Hebei Province, the smooth ecological water replenishment effectively restored the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, and was also conducive to the replenishment and nourishment of groundwater along the river bank; besides greatly improving the living and economic development environment, it is deeply significant in the process of realizing the goal of "clear water, green shores, unobstructed courses, and beautiful scenery" for managing and protecting rivers and lakes.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">你们都应该知道我要讲的事实。</seg>
        <seg id="2">我认为不平等能够引起社会分裂和腐化的这种直觉 在法国大革命之前就存在了。</seg>
        <seg id="3">不同的是 我们现在可以找出证据， 我们可以通过比较社会，平等程度不同的社会， 来了解不平等导致的影响。</seg>
        <seg id="4">我将给你们展示一些数据 并解释为什么 那些数据确实存在关联。</seg>
        <seg id="5">但是首先，来看看我们的命有多苦。</seg>
        <seg id="6">（笑声） 我想以一个 矛盾开始我的演讲。</seg>
        <seg id="7">这张图显示了我们的平均寿命 相对于国民总收入的关系—— 后者衡量的是国家的平均富裕程度。</seg>
        <seg id="8">你们可以看看右侧的那些国家， 像挪威和美国， 它们的富裕程度是以色列、希腊、葡萄牙这些左侧的国家的两倍。</seg>
        <seg id="9">但这并没有影响它们国民的平均寿命。</seg>
        <seg id="10">没有相互关联的迹象。</seg>
        <seg id="11">但是如果我们去了解社会内部， 就能发现在它们整个社会内部 有很大的健康状况差异。</seg>
        <seg id="12">这张图展示的，依然是平均寿命。</seg>
        <seg id="13">这些都是英格兰和威尔士的小镇—— 最穷的在右侧，最富的在左侧。</seg>
        <seg id="14">穷人和其他人之间有很大的差异。</seg>
        <seg id="15">甚至是那些刚好在顶端之下的人， 他们的健康状况 都比在顶端的人要差。</seg>
        <seg id="16">所以收入在我们的社会中 意味非常， 但在不同社会间的的比较并没有意义。</seg>
        <seg id="17">那个矛盾的解释 就是，在我们社会中， 我们看的是相对收入 或者说社会地位、身份—— 就是我们之间的相互关系 以及人与人之间的差距大小。</seg>
        <seg id="18">一旦你有了那种想法， 你就应该马上想到： 如果差距扩大会发生什么？ 要是缩小差距呢？ 扩大或是减小收入差距会怎么样呢？</seg>
        <seg id="19">这就是我马上要告诉你们的。</seg>
        <seg id="20">我没有使用任何假设的数据。</seg>
        <seg id="21">我的数据来自联合国—— 和世界银行的数据一样—— 是关于这些富有、发达市场的 民主国家间的收入差距的。</seg>
        <seg id="22">我们用的方法， 简单易懂，并且你们可以下载， 就是比较每个国家的前 20% 与后 20% 的收入差距。</seg>
        <seg id="23">你们可以看到左侧的国家都比较平等—— 日本、芬兰、挪威、瑞典—— 他们的前 20% 的富裕程度大概是后 20% 的 3.5 到 4 倍。</seg>
        <seg id="24">但是在比较不平等的另外一侧—— 英国、葡萄牙、美国、新加坡—— 收入差距要大一倍。</seg>
        <seg id="25">按这种比较方式，我们国家（英国）的不平等程度是 另外一些同样成功的民主市场的两倍。</seg>
        <seg id="26">接下来我将会展示这对我们社会有什么影响。</seg>
        <seg id="27">我们针对社会内部差异产生的问题收集了数据， 这类问题在社会最底层 更加的普遍。</seg>
        <seg id="28">国际上可供比较的数据包括平均寿命、 儿童的数学和语文成绩、 婴儿死亡率、自杀率、 监狱人口比例、少女早孕率、 互信程度、 肥胖、心理疾病—— 这些病都符合标准的诊断分类 包括毒瘾和酒瘾—— 以及社会流动率。</seg>
        <seg id="29">我们把所有这些都归到一个系数里。</seg>
        <seg id="30">他们都被平均加权。</seg>
        <seg id="31">一个国家的分数就是这些因子平均得到的。</seg>
        <seg id="32">你可以看到，这些分数是 与刚才我展示过的不平等比较相关的， 我将反复展示这些数据。</seg>
        <seg id="33">越是不平等的国家 在各种社会问题上 表现得就越差。</seg>
        <seg id="34">关联性非常强。</seg>
        <seg id="35">但是如果你看同样的 健康和社会问题 与人均国民收入以及 国民总收入的指数的比较， 那你就什么也不会发现， 再没有相关性了。</seg>
        <seg id="36">我们有一点担心 人们可能会想 我们是挑选特定的问题以迎合我们的理论 然后人为的制造证据。 所以我们也在《英国医学期刊》发表了一篇关于 联合国儿童基金会儿童福利指数的论文。</seg>
        <seg id="37">它包含 40 个不同的部分， 来自他人的总结。</seg>
        <seg id="38">它包括儿童是否能与父母交谈， 家中是否有图书， 免疫率有多少，以及学校是否存在欺辱现象。</seg>
        <seg id="39">所有都包括进去了。</seg>
        <seg id="40">这就是该指数与同样的不平等程度的关系。</seg>
        <seg id="41">在越不平等的社会，儿童的表现就越差。</seg>
        <seg id="42">关系及其显著。</seg>
        <seg id="43">但是再一次， 如果你看的是儿童福利 与人均国民收入的关系， 你将一无所获。 没有关联的迹象。</seg>
        <seg id="44">我目前向你们展示的所有数据所揭示的 都是同一样的东西。</seg>
        <seg id="45">我们社会的平均福利 再也不是取决于 国民收入和经济增长。</seg>
        <seg id="46">它们在较穷的国家非常重要， 但是对于富裕的发达国家来说却并非如此。</seg>
        <seg id="47">而我们之间的差异 以及我们相对于他人的位置 如今看来非常重要。</seg>
        <seg id="48">下面我将为大家展示我们指数的一些分部。</seg>
        <seg id="49">这是相互信任指数。</seg>
        <seg id="50">指的是同意大多数人都可信 的人数比例。</seg>
        <seg id="51">这是来自“世界价值观调查”的数据。</seg>
        <seg id="52">可以看到，在较不平等的一侧， 大约有 15% 的人 感觉他们能相信他人。</seg>
        <seg id="53">但是在更加平等的社会， 这一比例上升到了 60% 或 65%。</seg>
        <seg id="54">如果再看社区活动参与度 或者是社会资本的评估， 都有非常相似的关联 与不平等紧密相关。</seg>
        <seg id="55">我要说，我们重复了这项工作两次。</seg>
        <seg id="56">第一次针对的是这些富裕发达国家， 我们之后更换了测试对象， 对美国 50 个州重复了这个测试—— 调查同样的问题： 是否那些越是不平等的州 在所有这些评估上就做得越差？</seg>
        <seg id="57">这是联邦政府在一项一般社会调查中得出的相互信任 与不平等之间的关系。</seg>
        <seg id="58">非常相似的散点分布 在相似的信任程度范围上。</seg>
        <seg id="59">同样的事情还在继续。</seg>
        <seg id="60">基本上我们发现 几乎所有在国际调查中反映出来的与互信有关的因素 也同样反映在我们分别调查的 50 个州里面。</seg>
        <seg id="61">这并非巧合。</seg>
        <seg id="62">这张图是心理疾病。</seg>
        <seg id="63">世界卫生组织通过随机采样 采用相同的诊断采访方式 搜集数据 使得我们能够比较每个社会的 心理疾病率。</seg>
        <seg id="64">这是上一年患有任意一种 心理疾病人口的比率。</seg>
        <seg id="65">它的范围是从 8% 直到 24% 多—— 这表明整个社会 患有心理疾病的比例是其它社会的 3 倍。</seg>
        <seg id="66">同样的，这些都与不平等有着紧密的联系。</seg>
        <seg id="67">这张图是犯罪率。</seg>
        <seg id="68">红点表示美国各州， 蓝三角表示加拿大各省。</seg>
        <seg id="69">但是看看它们的数量差异。</seg>
        <seg id="70">谋杀率从每一百万 15 起 直到 150 起。</seg>
        <seg id="71">这是监狱囚犯的比率。</seg>
        <seg id="72">这是 10 倍的差距， 指数函数会放大这差距。</seg>
        <seg id="73">但监禁人数的变化范围 是从 40 到 400。</seg>
        <seg id="74">犯罪 并非这一关系的主要原因。</seg>
        <seg id="75">在一些地方，犯罪可以解释一部分原因。</seg>
        <seg id="76">但是更多的是严厉的审判， 或者说更苛刻的审判。</seg>
        <seg id="77">社会越是不平等 就越倾向于保留死刑。</seg>
        <seg id="78">这张图是儿童高中辍学状况。</seg>
        <seg id="79">同样，差距很大。</seg>
        <seg id="80">如果我们讨论社会人才的选拔， 就会发现这种差距的危害非常严重。</seg>
        <seg id="81">这张图是社会流动率。</seg>
        <seg id="82">实际上是基于收入的 流动率计算。</seg>
        <seg id="83">基本上，它所追问的是： 是否富爸爸有富孩子 穷爸爸有穷孩子， 或者这两者之间没有任何关系？</seg>
        <seg id="84">在较不平等的一侧， 爸爸的收入更加的重要—— 比如说英国、美国。</seg>
        <seg id="85">而在北欧， 爸爸的收入就不那么重要。</seg>
        <seg id="86">那里有更多的社会阶层流动。</seg>
        <seg id="87">正如我们常说的—— 我知道这里有很多美国听众—— 如果美国人想要实现他们的“美国梦”， 他们应该去丹麦。</seg>
        <seg id="88">（笑声） （掌声） 我已经展示过的在这里用斜体字标记。</seg>
        <seg id="89">我还可以展示一些其它的问题。</seg>
        <seg id="90">那些问题都更普遍存在 于社会梯度的底层。</seg>
        <seg id="91">但是社会梯度存在着无穷的问题， 这些问题在不平等的国家显得更糟—— 不仅仅是一点点糟， 而是什么都要差到 2 倍 10 倍。</seg>
        <seg id="92">想想花费， 人力成本的花费。</seg>
        <seg id="93">我想回到这张先前展示过的图 我们把所有都结合起来 为了说明两点。</seg>
        <seg id="94">第一，通过一张复一张的图表， 我们发现那些表现较差的国家， 无论什么， 都似乎是那些更不平等的国家， 但是那些表现得好的 似乎都是北欧和日本。</seg>
        <seg id="95">所以我们看到的是 普遍社会紊乱与不平等之间的关系。</seg>
        <seg id="96">不仅仅是一两件事出了问题， 而是几乎所有事。</seg>
        <seg id="97">这张图上我想指出的另外一个很重要的点 就是，如果你看看底部， 瑞士和日本， 他们在所有方面都显示出他们是非常不同的国家。</seg>
        <seg id="98">妇女的地位， 他们对小家庭的坚守程度， 在富裕发达的国家之中， 是在两个极端。</seg>
        <seg id="99">但是另外一个很重要的不同就是 他们如何实现较大平等的。</seg>
        <seg id="100">瑞典在收入上有很大的差异， 但它用税收、 国家福利、 慷慨的救济等等来缩小差距。</seg>
        <seg id="101">日本则相当不同。</seg>
        <seg id="102">首先日本税前工资差距比较小。</seg>
        <seg id="103">它的税收较低。</seg>
        <seg id="104">它的福利也比较少。</seg>
        <seg id="105">而对美国各州的研究中， 我们发现了鲜明的对比。</seg>
        <seg id="106">有一些州表现好是通过再分配， 而另外有一些州表现好 是因为税前收入差距小。</seg>
        <seg id="107">所以我们得出结论 如何实现较大的平等并不重要， 重要的是能实现这种平等。</seg>
        <seg id="108">我不是在说完全的平等， 我说的都是确实存在于富裕发达市场民主国家的。</seg>
        <seg id="109">关于这个图，另外一个出乎意料的事情就是 不仅仅是穷人 会受不平等的影响。</seg>
        <seg id="110">约翰·多恩（英国诗人）的话似乎有点道理： “没有人是一座孤岛。”</seg>
        <seg id="111">通过一系列的研究，我们能够比较 每一个社会阶层的人在 平等程度或多或少的不同国家的行为。</seg>
        <seg id="112">这只是一个例子。</seg>
        <seg id="113">这张图是婴儿死亡率。</seg>
        <seg id="114">根据英国一般社会经济分类记录， 一些瑞典人非常仁慈的归类了很多婴儿死亡。</seg>
        <seg id="115">这是一种不符合时代的 基于父亲职位的分类， 所以单身母亲自成一组数据。</seg>
        <seg id="116">但是我们看所谓的“社会低级阶层”， 那是无需技术的手工工作。</seg>
        <seg id="117">中间是需要技术的手工工作， 再到高级非手工工作， 一直高到专业工作—— 医生、律师、 大公司的经理。</seg>
        <seg id="118">这里可以看出瑞典比英国做得好， 在每一个社会阶层上都做得更好。</seg>
        <seg id="119">最大的差异出现在社会的底层。</seg>
        <seg id="120">但即使是在顶端， 生活在一个较平等的社会 都有一些优势。</seg>
        <seg id="121">我们展示了 5 组不同的数据 包括了美国和国际的教育结果 以及健康状况。</seg>
        <seg id="122">似乎总体而言—— 较为平等的社会在社会底层展示出的差异最明显， 但在社会上层也同样会有一些优势。</seg>
        <seg id="123">我该解释一下怎么回事。</seg>
        <seg id="124">我认为我是在展示和讨论 不平等对社会心理的影响。</seg>
        <seg id="125">更多的是关注优越感和自卑感， 被重视和被看不起， 被尊重和被贬低。</seg>
        <seg id="126">当然，那些由于 身份地位的竞争而产生的感觉 促动了社会消费主义的前进。</seg>
        <seg id="127">但它同样也导致了地位的不确保性。</seg>
        <seg id="128">我们更担心的是别人如何评判和看待我们， 我们是否显得有吸引力、聪明、 或是诸如此类。</seg>
        <seg id="129">社会价值评价增强了 对这些社会价值评价的恐惧。</seg>
        <seg id="130">有趣的是， 社会心理学领域一些类似的工作也在同样进行着： 一些人查阅了 208 项不同的研究； 在研究中，志愿者被邀请到 一个心理试验中心 然后测试他们的压力霍尔蒙以及 他们执行压力任务时的反应。</seg>
        <seg id="131">在这观察中， 科学家感兴趣是 哪一种压力 最能提高体内皮质醇， 最重要的压力霍尔蒙的水平。</seg>
        <seg id="132">结果正是 那些包括社会评价威胁的任务—— 威胁到自尊和社会地位的任务—— 这些任务中他人能负面评价你的表现。</seg>
        <seg id="133">这些压力 在压力生理学上 有非常特别的效果。</seg>
        <seg id="134">目前我们已经接受了批评。</seg>
        <seg id="135">当然，有些人不喜欢这个， 也有人发现这个很出人意料。</seg>
        <seg id="136">然而我还是应该告诉你们 当人们批评我们挑拣数据时， 我们从来没有这样做过。</seg>
        <seg id="137">我们有一个无条件的规定 如果我们的数据源包含所观测国家的数据， 那么我们就将其纳入分析。</seg>
        <seg id="138">我们的数据源决定 数据是否有效， 而不是我们。</seg>
        <seg id="139">否则就会产生偏差。</seg>
        <seg id="140">其它国家呢？</seg>
        <seg id="141">学术同行审查的期刊中， 有 200 项研究是关于健康与 收入和平等的关系的。</seg>
        <seg id="142">这并没有局限于这里的这些国家， 暗藏着一个很简单的证明。</seg>
        <seg id="143">同样的国家 同样的不平等测量方法， 问题一个接一个。</seg>
        <seg id="144">我们为什么不控制其它的因素呢?</seg>
        <seg id="145">我已经向大家展示了人均国民收入 并没有产生任何影响。</seg>
        <seg id="146">当然，另外有人在文献中应用了更为复杂的方法 在实验中排除了贫困、教育 等因素。</seg>
        <seg id="147">因果关系如何呢？</seg>
        <seg id="148">相关性本身并不能证明因果联系。</seg>
        <seg id="149">我们花了相当的时间。</seg>
        <seg id="150">确实，人们对我们这些结果的因果联系 有很好的了解。</seg>
        <seg id="151">我们对富裕发达国家 长期保持健康的驱动因素的理解中 最大的改变就是 来自社会的长期压力对免疫力 以及心血管系统的影响 有多重要</seg>
        <seg id="152">或者比如说，暴力在较不平等的国家 变得越来越普遍的原因 就是因为人们对自己被瞧不起非常敏感。</seg>
        <seg id="153">我要说，为了解决这个问题， 我们应该解决税后以及 税前的一系列问题。</seg>
        <seg id="154">我们应该限制收入， 遏制顶端的奖金收入文化。</seg>
        <seg id="155">我认为我们必须竭尽所能让我们的领导们 对员工负责。</seg>
        <seg id="156">我最后想要总结的 就是我们能够通过减少我们的收入差距来 提高我们的真实的生活质量。</seg>
        <seg id="157">这样的话，我们会发现我们突然就解决了 整个社会的社会心理健康问题， 那真是棒极了。</seg>
        <seg id="158">谢谢。</seg>

    <ref lang="en" translator="A">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution.</seg>
        <seg id="3">What's changed is we now can look at the evidence, we can compare societies, more and less equal societies, and see what inequality does.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist.</seg>
        <seg id="5">But first, see what a miserable lot we are.</seg>
        <seg id="6">(Laughter) I want to start though with a paradox.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average.</seg>
        <seg id="8">And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="9">And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.</seg>
        <seg id="10">There's no suggestion of a relationship there.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society.</seg>
        <seg id="12">This, again, is life expectancy.</seg>
        <seg id="13">These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="14">A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top.</seg>
        <seg id="16">So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us.</seg>
        <seg id="18">And as soon as you've got that idea, you should immediately wonder: what happens if we widen the differences, or compress them, make the income differences bigger or smaller?</seg>
        <seg id="19">And that's what I'm going to show you.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I'm not using any hypothetical data.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The measure we've used, because it's easy to understand and you can download it, is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country.</seg>
        <seg id="23">And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big.</seg>
        <seg id="25">On that measure, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We collected data on problems with social gradients, the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, on kids' maths and literacy scores, on infant mortality rates, homicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="29">We put them all in one index.</seg>
        <seg id="30">They're all weighted equally.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.</seg>
        <seg id="32">And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems.</seg>
        <seg id="34">It's an extraordinarily close correlation.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being.</seg>
        <seg id="37">It has 40 different components put together by other people.</seg>
        <seg id="38">It contains whether kids can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Everything goes into it.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Highly significant relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="43">But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="44">What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.</seg>
        <seg id="45">The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth.</seg>
        <seg id="46">That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="47">But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much.</seg>
        <seg id="48">I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Here, for instance, is trust.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted.</seg>
        <seg id="51">It comes from the World Values Survey.</seg>
        <seg id="52">You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.</seg>
        <seg id="53">But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.</seg>
        <seg id="54">And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I may say, we did all this work twice.</seg>
        <seg id="56">We did it first on these rich, developed countries, and then as a separate test bed, we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question: do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures?</seg>
        <seg id="57">So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Same thing is going on.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed.</seg>
        <seg id="61">We're not just talking about a fluke.</seg>
        <seg id="62">This is mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society.</seg>
        <seg id="64">This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year.</seg>
        <seg id="65">And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others.</seg>
        <seg id="66">And again, closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This is violence.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the differences.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This is the proportion of the population in prison.</seg>
        <seg id="72">There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.</seg>
        <seg id="73">But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.</seg>
        <seg id="74">That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime.</seg>
        <seg id="75">In some places, that's part of it.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing.</seg>
        <seg id="77">And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">Here we have children dropping out of high school.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, quite big differences.</seg>
        <seg id="80">Extraordinarily damaging, if you're talking about using the talents of the population.</seg>
        <seg id="81">This is social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It's actually a measure of mobility based on income.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two?</seg>
        <seg id="84">And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA.</seg>
        <seg id="85">And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.</seg>
        <seg id="86">There's more social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="87">And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.</seg>
        <seg id="88">(Laughter) (Applause) I've shown you just a few things in italics here.</seg>
        <seg id="89">I could have shown a number of other problems.</seg>
        <seg id="90">They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think of the expense, the human cost of that.</seg>
        <seg id="93">I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.</seg>
        <seg id="94">One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="95">So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="96">It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things.</seg>
        <seg id="97">The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that, if you look at the bottom, Sweden and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="99">But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality.</seg>
        <seg id="100">Sweden has huge differences in earnings, and it narrows the gap through taxation, general welfare state, generous benefits and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="101">Japan is rather different though.</seg>
        <seg id="102">It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.</seg>
        <seg id="103">It has lower taxes.</seg>
        <seg id="104">It has a smaller welfare state.</seg>
        <seg id="105">And in our analysis of the American states, we find rather the same contrast.</seg>
        <seg id="106">There are some states that do well through redistribution, some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax.</seg>
        <seg id="107">So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality, as long as you get there somehow.</seg>
        <seg id="108">I am not talking about perfect equality, I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="110">There seems to be some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."</seg>
        <seg id="111">And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy.</seg>
        <seg id="112">This is just one example.</seg>
        <seg id="113">It's infant mortality.</seg>
        <seg id="114">Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.</seg>
        <seg id="115">And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their own.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But then where it says "low social class," that's unskilled manual occupations.</seg>
        <seg id="117">It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of larger companies.</seg>
        <seg id="118">You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy.</seg>
        <seg id="119">The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.</seg>
        <seg id="120">But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society.</seg>
        <seg id="121">We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.</seg>
        <seg id="122">And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.</seg>
        <seg id="123">But I should say a few words about what's going on.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="125">More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.</seg>
        <seg id="127">It also leads to status insecurity.</seg>
        <seg id="128">We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're regarded as attractive, clever, all that kind of thing.</seg>
        <seg id="129">The social-evaluative judgments increase, the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Interestingly, some parallel work going on in social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones, their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.</seg>
        <seg id="131">And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone.</seg>
        <seg id="132">And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance.</seg>
        <seg id="133">Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.</seg>
        <seg id="134">Now we have been criticized.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">Our data source decides whether it's reliable data, we don't.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise that would introduce bias.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What about other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.</seg>
        <seg id="142">This isn't confined to these countries here, hiding a very simple demonstration.</seg>
        <seg id="143">The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why don't we control for other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">What about causality?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We spend a good bit of time.</seg>
        <seg id="150">And indeed, people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes.</seg>
        <seg id="151">The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system, the cardiovascular system.</seg>
        <seg id="152">Or for instance, the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.</seg>
        <seg id="153">I should say that to deal with this, we've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.</seg>
        <seg id="158">Thank you.</seg>
        <seg id="159">(Applause)</seg>

        <seg id="3">During the small hours of July 26, the convective weather caused by strong wind and sudden downpours dispersed the intense heat that had lasted for several days; the rain will last for another several days.</seg>
        <seg id="4">According to the report from the Beijing Meteorological Service released at 11:00 on July 26, there will be scattered showers on July 26 in Beijing (with weak thunder and lightning), and the highest temperature will be just 27 degrees Celsius; at night, it will be cloudy with light to moderate rain (with weak thunder and lightning), and the lowest temperature will be 23 degrees Celsius.</seg>
        <seg id="5">However, on July 24 and 25, Beijing was under a blue alert for high temperature; the highest temperature of most regions was 37 degrees Celsius, while some regions were even hotter, with a temperature of over 40 degrees Celsius.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Sanfu is the period with the highest temperature and humidity within a year, consisting of “three phases” every year, the second of which is the hottest, the period when people “lose their appetites”.</seg>
        <seg id="7">As the sanfu days draw near, people always fill their homes with diverse grains, and “eating dumplings for the first phase of Sanfu, while eating noodles for the second” is a long-lasting folk custom.</seg>
        <seg id="8">According to current weather reports, in the next three days, there will be clouds and rain in Beijing.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The meteorological service reminds us that mountain tours should be reduced in case of geological disasters.</seg>
        <seg id="10">It is estimated that the second phase of Sanfu will last for 20 days, from July 26 to August 14.</seg>
        <seg id="11">During these days, people always feel feeble and have no appetite.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Therefore, mung beans and coix seeds should be eaten to clear the heat, invigorate the spleen, and stimulate the appetite, and bitter foods such as sow thistle and bitter gourd can also be eaten for the same functions.</seg>

        <seg id="2">On the 24th, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive demanding an urgent inspection of the roughly 2,000 737NG and 737 Classic airliners registered in the US due to the fact that corrosion of the airliners’ air check valves may cause the engines to stall while in midair.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The FAA said it has received reports of 4 incidents of 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft engines stalling in midair, so it has issued the emergency inspection order for all passenger aircraft that have been idled for 7 days or more or reactivated aircraft which have made fewer than 11 flights.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The FAA warned that if the Level 5 check valves in both engines of a passenger airliner become corroded, they may become stuck in the open position, causing the aircraft to completely lose power and be unable to restart its engines.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The regulatory agency’s order stipulates that if a check valve is found to be corroded, this critical component must be immediately replaced by the operator before the airplane may be returned to service.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Boeing responded later the same day, saying that because many aircraft had been idled or used less frequently due to the lower demand for travel caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, “which can make check valves more susceptible to corrosion”.</seg>
        <seg id="7">At the same time, Boeing stated it has advised all operators to immediately inspect aircraft affected by the order, and if problems are discovered, Boeing will provide repair, replacement air check valves, and similar assistance.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The AP reported that aircraft owned by major US carriers typically fly several times a day, but due to the COVID-19 epidemic, a large number of airlines have been idled; as return for travel has gradually started to return, some of these aircraft have been returned to service.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Details of the 4 reported stalling incidents were not released by the FAA.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Later on the 24th, Alaska Airlines disclosed that one of the incidents occurred on their aircraft.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The airline released a statement claiming that as its aircraft was flying from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas, one of the engines suddenly stalled, and the aircraft finally made an emergency landing in Austin.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Alaska Airlines said it had already replaced the aircraft’s engine and had inspected the engines of 6 more aircraft as directed by the FAA.</seg>
        <seg id="13">On the 24th, American Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines stated they had not experienced air check valve-related engine stalling on their aircraft.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Four American Airlines aircraft will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines aircraft will be inspected.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Delta Airlines declared that it will inspect the 20 affected aircraft it operates, but that no stalling incidents had occurred on its aircraft.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Reports from several press bureaus note that the FAA emergency Airworthiness Directive was another blow to Boeing.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Indonesia’s Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines each experienced a Boeing 737 Max crash in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, with a total of 346 fatalities.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Flights of this model were subsequently grounded globally, production ceased in January of this year, and was resumed in May of this year.</seg>
        <seg id="19">FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson admitted in June that the FAA “made a mistake” in its supervision of the 737 Max.</seg>

        <seg id="2">HONG KONG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chief Secretary for Administration of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said on July 26 that the situation of COVID-19 in Hong Kong continued to be severe, and if the epidemic turned worse, the HKSAR Government would decisively enact more stringent control measures to further restrict business operations and reduce the activity space for people.</seg>
        <seg id="3">But at present, the SAR government has no intention to enact a "Stay-at-Home Order" or "Restriction Order" that restrict people from going out.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Cheung Kin-chung published a weblog post on the same day entitled All-out efforts to combat epidemic at critical juncture.</seg>
        <seg id="5">He said the current wave of the outbreak was the most serious one over the past six months and the coming fortnight would be crucial in the fight against further spread of the coronavirus in the community.</seg>
        <seg id="6">While the Government would take all necessary measures in this battle, it was equally important for the public to exercise self-discipline and cooperation.</seg>
        <seg id="7">He earnestly urged members of the public to stay home as much as possible, minimize social contact, and refrain from dining out.</seg>
        <seg id="8">In compliance with the compulsory measures, citizens should wear a face mask to protect themselves and others while observing personal and environmental hygiene and washing their hands frequently, and should also suspend non-essential social or meal gatherings and reduce their visits to markets.</seg>
        <seg id="9">He emphasized that the Central Authorities had all along taken heed of the changes in Hong Kong’s epidemic situation and staunchly supported the anti-epidemic work of the HKSAR Government, and in response to the recent request of the Chief Executive, the Central Authorities offered timely assistance in enhancing the virus testing capacity and retrofitting AsiaWorld-Expo into a makeshift facility similar to the “mobile cabin hospital” on the Mainland.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Meanwhile, he stated that the Government’s initiative to provide free COVID-19 testing for designated high-risk groups was running at full steam, which would cover some 400,000 persons including staff of residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs), residential care homes for persons with disabilities, as well as nursing homes, restaurant workers, taxi drivers, and property management staff.</seg>
        <seg id="11">He was very concerned about the recent emergence of local infection cases in RCHEs, so to meet such needs, the Government has arranged to set up designated temporary quarantine centers.</seg>
        <seg id="12">He also said that quarantine facilities were being built in the vicinity of Penny’s Bay Quarantine Center at Lantau Island, and 700 additional units were expected to be available by the end of September.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The Chief Executive also announced on the 19th that the Government would build an additional 2,000 units at Penny’s Bay and strive to complete them by the end of this year.</seg>
        <seg id="14">With the commissioning of 800 quarantine units constructed on the Government land, the total number of quarantine units provided at Penny’s Bay will add up to 3,500.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Currently, a total of about 2,600 units are in operation under four quarantine centers in Hong Kong.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Besides, Lei Yue Mun Park and Holiday Village on Hong Kong Island has been converted into community isolation facilities since July 24 for COVID-19 patients who are under the age of 50 with self-care capabilities.</seg>

        <seg id="2">2020-07-26 17:37:29 Source: www.ce.cn Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing</seg>
        <seg id="3">In recent days, General Secretary Xi Jinping said while visiting the Siping Battle Memorial Hall, “It is necessary for 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, to learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well. "</seg>
        <seg id="4">Studying the history of the Party and the history of New China is a compulsory course for party members and cadres to stay true to the original aspiration and founding mission; we should draw rich nourishment from history, build a strong sense of family and country, and walk the long march of the new era.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The magnificent history of the Party and New China records the hard work and glorious history of the Communist Party of China since its founding, and demonstrates the faith and loyalty that the Communists have forged with their lives and blood, as well as the original aspiration and founding mission that they will always adhere to.</seg>
        <seg id="6">History is the best textbook, and for members and cadres of the Party, the history of Party and New China are the brightest chapters in this textbook.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Every member and cadre of the Party must continuously strengthen their historical thinking of using history as a mirror and moving towards the future, based on the new journey and new mission, accept the "relay baton" of the times, and walk the long march of the new era.</seg>
        <seg id="8">We must cast the soul with history, and stick to the original mission in the study of the history of the Party and New China.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Looking through the history of the Party and New China, we find it is full of the eternal and unchanging original aspiration and founding mission of the Chinese Communists and the adherence to rock-solid convictions, which demonstrates the simple desire of the Communists to walk with the people forever.</seg>
        <seg id="10">To understand important events, important meetings, and important figures in the history of the Party and New China up close is not only an intuitive baptism of thought, but also a deep understanding of the connotations of the original aspiration and the weight of the founding mission.</seg>
        <seg id="11">For the Party members and cadres, if they want to continuously forge their original aspiration and founding mission and maintain their advanced qualities, they must find the starting point and the fulcrum of our original intention from the history of the Party and New China, maintain a clear understanding and a firm stand, and find the strength to fight bravely for the country and the people and ensure that the red world their revolutionary ancestors laid down with their blood and lives will be passed on from generation to generation.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Studying history can make people wise, so we can inherit the noble spirit in the study of the history of the Party and New China.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the Red Boat Spirit, the Jinggangshan Spirit, the Long March Spirit, the Yan'an Spirit, the Anti-Japanese War Spirit, the Xibaipo Spirit, the "Two Bombs and One Satellite" Spirit, and the Aerospace Spirit.</seg>
        <seg id="14">These great spirits precipitated by history have provided the Party with a powerful spiritual incentive to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward, and are a precious spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away, or taken away.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The process of studying the history of the Party and China is a process of reviewing these spirits and shaping one's own spirit; we must conscientiously use the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as a mirror, stay true to the spiritual home of the Communists, and lay a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, and we should also inherit and carry forward these spirits, and make them glow with the light of the new era.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Reading history can make people reflect; we must continue to preserve righteousness and dispel evil in the study of the history of the Party and New China, .</seg>
        <seg id="17">For Party members and cadres, there has never been any history that can deliver more profound warning, enlightenment, and reference than the history of the Party and New China.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In the history of the Party and New China, we can see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who were determined to devote themselves to their faith and persevere in striving to achieve the established goals, but we also see the profound lessons of certain figures who were shaken in their ideals and beliefs and came to the opposite side of the revolution, which enlighten and warn us never to stop or slack off in our firm determination and will, always maintain a strong fighting spirit, continuously purify the spirit of the Party, and be self-disciplined.</seg>
        <seg id="19">To truly become a firm believer and loyal practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, one needs to clean off ideological “dust” and guard against “dirt”; the history of the Party and New China should become the basis for every Party member and cadre to examine and warn himself.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Knowing history can inspire people; we should bravely take on the important tasks of the times in the study of the history of the Party and New China.</seg>
        <seg id="21">General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out, "Learning the history of the Party and the country is a compulsory course for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and continuing to advance the various undertakings of the Party and the country. "</seg>
        <seg id="22">Looking back at history and seeking our original aspirations allows us to maintain our glory and move towards a bright future.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Every Party member and cadre should adopt the study of the history of the Party and New China as lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in their studies, and bravely assume the historical mission, dare to assume responsibility, and act proactively in our respective jobs.</seg>
        <seg id="24">We should adhere to the reference and guidance of the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries, constantly refine the political nature of the communists, maintain the attitude of struggle in seizing the day and making every effort, and the spirit of struggle in spite of the difficulties and hardships; in the great journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, we must write a brilliant stroke of our own.</seg>

        <seg id="2">(China poverty reduction story) “The Great Wall in Jiangnan”, seeking the poetry of the “Yellow River Dream”</seg>
        <seg id="3">China News Service, Yinchuan, reported July 26 (Yang Di) “Countless li of sands along the Yellow River’s endless turns as waves and wind rush onward from the horizon. “</seg>
        <seg id="4">The Yellow River, which has inspired the passions of countless poets, birthed the beautiful and bountiful Ningxia Plain, and today, Ningxia, which bears the fond epithet “The Great Wall of Jiangnan”, upholds the concept of “environment first, green development” as it pursues the poetry of the “Yellow River Dream”.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The “Jade Dream” of clear river water</seg>
        <seg id="6">“The Yellow River brings all under heaven to enrich Ningxia” as it runs its 397 km course through the province, making it the “mother river” that provides the region’s resources.</seg>
        <seg id="7">However, because of rapid industrialization and urbanization, the utilization, management, and protection of rivers and lakes has become imbalanced, with factors such as excessive sewage, land reclamation, and invasive practices leading to black and smelly waters, declining water quality, dirty natural environments, and ecological degradation.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Today, Ningxia is working to restore a wide variety of water bodies, and striving to make the Yellow River flow with clear, beautiful water.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Treating the waters begins at the source.</seg>
        <seg id="10">In Ningxia’s Yinchuan, through a “raising standards + cleaning up pollution + strict management” method, all wastewater from industrial parks is collected and treated, all urban water treatment plants have achieved Class A discharge standards, bodies of dark and smelly water in built-up urban areas have essentially been eliminated, and the city’s application to be included in the Third Batch of China Model Cities for Dark and Odorous Water Management has been approved.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In addition, in 2017, Ningxia comprehensively implemented its long-distance lakes and rivers management regulation, and has now achieved full coverage of its five-level responsibility system for these regulations across all urban and rural areas, meaning that long-distance river and lake patrols have become a common site.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Gu Jincheng, 64, a resident of a village near the Yellow River, has personally witnessed the river’s transformation, and says, “The water used to stink, but after cleaning and treatment, the smell is gone. “</seg>
        <seg id="13">He says that with an improved environment, his life has become more comfortable, and he now often takes walks with his relatives by the Yellow River, where they appreciate the clear water and blue skies.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The “Wetland Dream” of sand and circling gulls</seg>
        <seg id="15">Birds, green trees, wooden roads, clear water... the beautiful Ningxia scenery described in Fan Zhongyan’s “Sand, Geese, and Feathers Chronicle” has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.</seg>
        <seg id="16">As the Yellow River flows through Ningxia, it forms river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands, and other wetlands along its route, which play a critical role in the rational management of water resources and maintaining ecological balance, and internationally, have also become important stops on the migration routes of birds.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Since 2009, the related departments in Ningxia have invested a total of 3.45 billion RMB in wetland protection projects; presently, Yinchuan’s wetlands cover 19,200 hectares, of which 78.5% are protected areas; Yinchuan has nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands, has 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region wetland parks, and 8 municipal parks.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center Lu Jinhu expressed to this reporter that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is especially apparent in the variety of bird species, “The relict gull is endangered, with just over 20,000 left in the world, of which more than 2,000 nest in Yinchuan wetlands. “</seg>
        <seg id="19">Ningxia has also passed laws that delineate a 500-meter “red line” wetland protection zone on both sides of the Yellow River, and which bans all development, construction, and business activities in the protected zone except for public welfare projects.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservation Service Center, says that source management of pollution, overall restoration and improvement of lake and river ecosystems, and wetland terminal construction, 100% of the water flowing in Ningxia’s 9 major drainage channels into the Yellow River reaches Class IV standards, and he adds, “Now the water is clear, fish swim in it, and flowers bloom around it. “</seg>
        <seg id="21">The “Drinking Water Dream” of universal livelihood improvement</seg>
        <seg id="22">Yinchuan in Ningxia once bore an “awkward” honorific: the only city to look out on the banks of the Yellow River that lacks drinking water.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Starting in 2010, Yinchuan faced perennial water shortages during the peak summer season, and over the past decade, this water shortage has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise dwellers, but with all major water sources extremely stressed and the city’s drilling and exploitation of huge areas of groundwater, water shortages were a significant problem for Yinchuan.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But thanks to the improvements in the quality of the Yellow River’s water, purifying the river water has become a way to supply drinking water to local residents.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, said that to meet Yinchuan’s demand for residential water, Ningxia initiated the Yinchuan Municipal Western Water Supply Line project in time to replace the city’s original groundwater supply with high-quality water from the Yellow River.</seg>
        <seg id="26">“The project officially began supplying water to Yinchuan on December 29, 2019, and in 2020, the residents of Minning Town and Helan County also began to drink Yellow River water.” “</seg>
        <seg id="27">Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan Water Conservation Department is considering integrating urban water supply and rural drinking water provision, stating, “Our next step is to integrate the scattered water supplies in rural areas and connect them to the Western Water Supply Line Project, and by the end of the year, we expect to essentially integrate all of Yinchuan’s urban and rural water supply systems. “</seg>

        <seg id="2">The US Department of Commerce recently announced that it has decided to initiate anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into Chinese strapping products, as well as an investigation on the "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project.</seg>
        <seg id="3">China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has launched an anti-subsidy case to investigate the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project, and China is firmly opposed to this.</seg>
        <seg id="4">China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.</seg>
        <seg id="5">“On the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and is not undervalued,” the press release stressed.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.</seg>
        <seg id="7">According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate by 49%, making it the most powerful currency among the G20 economies and one of the currencies with the highest appreciation in the world.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue goes beyond the members' authority to conduct anti-subsidy investigations in accordance with the WTO rules.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In February this year, the United States amended its laws and regulations to conduct anti-subsidy investigations into other countries' exchange rates, which is suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Even under U.S. regulations, the applicant's complaint contains a number of errors and lacks the necessary anti-subsidy elements such as financial aid, grant of benefits and exclusivity, the press release said.</seg>
        <seg id="11">China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting anti-subsidy investigations on the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate".</seg>
        <seg id="12">The offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates fell sharply against the US dollar on the 22nd, both falling below the mark of USD $1 to RMB 7.0 as tensions between China and the US escalated.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It is a matter of concern whether the U.S. Department of Commerce's move is intended to push up the RMB.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The spot exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar rose above 7.0 on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The central parity rate of the RMB against the US dollar, which is regulated by the government, fell 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.</seg>

        <seg id="2">At a memorial service held in his remembrance on Saturday, July 25th, US Congressperson and civil rights activist John Lewis was described as a “fighter for the least of us”.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Public memorial services for Lewis have been open to the public since Saturday in Alabama.</seg>
        <seg id="4">On the first day, two memorial services were held.</seg>
        <seg id="5">At the memorial service held on Saturday at Alabama’s Troy University, Lewis’s five brothers and sisters and one grandson described him as a deeply caring and courageous family man.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Lewis’s younger brother, Henry “Grant” Lewis, said at the service, “He dedicated his life to the service of others. “</seg>
        <seg id="7">Samuel Lewis said his mother warned Lewis, “Not to make trouble, don’t make trouble. “</seg>
        <seg id="8">He added that John ignored his mother’s warning, and continued, “We all knew John would always make trouble, always get into trouble, but it was always to stand up for the right thing, so it was a good trouble. “</seg>
        <seg id="9">Lewis’s brothers and sisters told those in attendance at the service that John’s most famous point of argument was that people should create “good trouble”, which is to say that he would never shy away from causing trouble for the sake of justice.</seg>
        <seg id="10">John once applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but he was rejected because it was an all-white school at the time.</seg>
        <seg id="11">John Lewis, who preached to chickens on his family farm as a child, finally earned his degree in religion and philosophy at Fisk University.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Several years later, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Troy University.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Alabama Senator Doug Jones said current protestors are “protesting peacefully and non-violently”, just as John Lewis protested during the Civil Rights Movement.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Jones continued, “Even though President Trump tarred all the protesters with the same brush by describing them as thugs, he was wrong.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The protesters are patriots who want America to become a more equal country. “</seg>
        <seg id="16">The six-day series of events to remember Lewis’s life will conclude with a funeral in Georgia this week.</seg>
        <seg id="17">On Saturday, Lewis’s coffin was exhibited at a public memorial service at Troy University, where members of the public came to pay their respects to this civil rights pioneer.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Later, on Saturday evening, a private memorial service was held for people to pay their respects at a church in Selma, Alabama, after which a private memorial service was held.</seg>
        <seg id="19">On Sunday, Lewis’s remains will be carried across Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In 1965, Lewis and several other demonstrators demanding the right to vote for Blacks were beaten viciously by Alabama police on this bridge, and the police also fired tear gas into the crowd.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Lewis was nearly killed by his injuries.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Later, that day became known as “Bloody Sunday”.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Then, Lewis’s remains will be shipped to Alabama’s capital city Montgomery.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete Lewis’s final journey with him.</seg>
        <seg id="25">However, officials also reminded participants that they should wear masks and maintain social distance.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered that the state flag be flown at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis’s memory.</seg>
        <seg id="27">During the near-week of memorial events, Lewis’s remains will briefly visit the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington to allow members of the public to express condolences.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Last week, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that members of the public can visit the U.S. Capitol Building on Monday or Tuesday to pay their respects to Lewis.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Public memorial events for Lewis will be held outdoors due to the coronavirus epidemic.</seg>

        <seg id="2">SHENZHEN, July 26, 2020 (Xinhua, by Mao Siqian and Bai Yu) Local residents are encouraged to perform physical examinations frequently to detect abnormalities as early as possible; alcohol beverages are not to be sold to minors; a healthy censorship system for online games is to be build; employers should employ both full-time and part-time health staff... Recently, the Health Regulations of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (draft for comments) was officially published, meaning citizens of Shenzhen will have their own “Health Law”.</seg>
        <seg id="3">In order to encourage local residents to perform a physical evaluation to detect abnormalities as early as possible, the draft for comments proposed that heath agencies should establish a basic catalogue for physical evaluation programs based on factors including age and job.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Personal physical evaluation fees covered by the basic catalogue should be paid annually by social and medical insurance funds.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The draft for comments clarified that, the employers should arrange their human resources appropriately, reasonably coordinating their time schedule, and to prevent staff spending too much physical and mental efforts at work, a rotating schedule should be well-implemented, so that issues due to excessive physical and mental exertion can be avoided, and also strictly implement a paid leave system.</seg>
        <seg id="6">In addition, the employers should employ full-time and part-time health staff, and organize physical evaluations for staff regularly.</seg>
        <seg id="7">In terms of the physical and mental health of minors, the draft for comments prohibited the sales of alcohol beverage to minors, with the restriction of sales places, and proposed that those who disobey the rules will be asked to correct themselves by Market Supervisory Authorities and be fined RMB 30,000.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Apart from “no alcohol”, the minors should also “exercise more”.</seg>
        <seg id="9">According to the requirements of the draft for comments, schools should allow more than one hour for student physical activities.</seg>
        <seg id="10">In terms of online games, authorities including the police, cultural broadcast tourism sports, online supervision, health, and so on should improve the health supervision systems of online service providers and venues amd build a health censorship system for online games to establish healthy communication environment and etiquette for the adolescents.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Beyond that, the public comment draft also pointed out that flu patients must wear masks when entering public venues, and if health institutions leak the private information of patients, they will be fined RMB 20,000.</seg>
        <seg id="12">One thing worthy of attention apart from the physical and mental health of residents is that the draft for comments also required that before making plans and regulatory documents related to urban space planning and construction, industrial park plan and construction, resource exploration and environmental protection, the development of Biological Medicine, alongside approving major construction projects and implementing major public service projects, departments of the Shenzhen government should evaluate the influence of those public policies upon people’s health.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Unevaluated policies or evaluated ones that would have severe side effects on urban public sanitation or people’s health should not be issued or approved for implementation.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Adhering to the guidance of Party building and implementing the Party's leadership in all fields and links of grassroots social governance is the fundamental requirement of doing a good job in grassroots social governance.</seg>

        <seg id="6">To strengthen the political leadership of grassroots social governance, it is necessary to implement the "calcium supplementation and soul forging" project.</seg>
        <seg id="7">It is necessary to deeply study and thoroughly understand Xi Jinping’s thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, take “remain true to our original aspiration and keep our mission firmly in mind” as the eternal theme of Party building and the lifelong theme of Party members and cadres, and strengthen the idea of reading the original work, learning the original text and understanding the principles; we should promote the solidification of the Party’s innovative theories through special training, batch training, seminars, exchanges, holding forums, and so on; and Party members and cadres should further enhance the "Four Consciousnesses", strengthen "Four-sphere Confidence", and achieve the "Two Upholds" to better perform their duties and responsibilities.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, we should broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide the grassroots Party organizations and Party members and cadres to truly and regularly integrate learning and education into their daily activities.</seg>
        <seg id="9">We should pay attention to practice and address the problematic and disturbing issues that the masses are concerned about, and forge the Party’s spirit and ability in the process of resolving key and difficult problems in the field of grassroots social governance,</seg>
        <seg id="10">We should improve our standards and play a key role in grassroots governance.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Grassroots Party organizations are not only an important part of the grassroots social governance system, but also an important carrier for the manifestation of governance capabilities.</seg>
        <seg id="12">To promote the standardized construction of grassroots Party organizations, we should start by grasping the regulations on the work of Party branches and addressing the problem of the leadership of Party organizations being weak and ineffective; we must consolidate the foundation, reduce the weaknesses, and promote development by establishing an up-down linkage mechanism, innovating the form of branch establishment, normalizing the weak and lax parts, establishing and improving decision-making and discussion mechanisms, and the mechanisms of serving the masses.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In rural areas, we should strengthen the standardization-building of village level Party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities, and management mechanism in accordance with the standardization construction standards of Party branches, and earnestly promote the detailed implementation of “the system of holding Party branch general meetings, meetings of Party branch committees, Party group meetings, and Party lectures" and thematical Party activities.</seg>
        <seg id="14">In terms of urban governance, we should pay attention to sub-district communities, explore and innovate the form of branch establishment, focus on weak areas, "blocking points", and "pain points", and actively build the urban Party-building alliance to realize effective coverage of the Party's work.</seg>
        <seg id="15">At the same time, we should establish and improve the systems and mechanisms of grassroots social governance, improve the decision-making and discussion mechanisms for discussing major issues, doing practical things, deciding important matters, discussing urgent matters, and solving difficult matters led by grassroots Party organizations; we should improve the mechanisms of Party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather people's hearts in serving the people, and enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor, and pride of the masses to make grassroots social governance more enticing.</seg>
        <seg id="16">We should play a vanguard role and gather red power.</seg>

        <seg id="19">It is necessary to take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for grassroots Party members and cadres, constantly strengthen ideological refinement, professional training, and practical training, the spirit of carrying forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and in urgent, difficult, and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation for and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities.</seg>
        <seg id="20">It is necessary to extensively carry out the activities of "community whistleblowing, party members reporting", through participating in thematic Party activities, contacting people in difficult situations, determining service projects, acknowledging micro-desires, and making reasonable suggestions, to participate in community construction, management, and service, so that Party members can play a role in community governance.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed Party members in rural areas, and guide the majority of grassroots Party members to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, petitioning and stability maintenance, and banning straw burning by setting up unemployed Party member vanguard posts and forming unemployed Party member work teams to better integrate red forces and serve the people.</seg>

        <seg id="3">五道梁保护站附近的监控画面显示，7月25日，大约40只雌性藏羚羊带领3只藏羚羊幼仔陆续通过青藏公路3002公里处、青藏铁路五道梁北大桥，藏羚羊已经开始回迁。</seg>
        <seg id="4">专家分析，近年来，回迁羊群中藏羚羊幼仔数量占藏羚羊群总体数量的四分之一至五分之一。</seg>
        <seg id="5">中国科学院西北高原生物研究所副研究员连新明说：“回迁初期，藏羚羊面临较高的被捕食风险，因此羊群中的幼仔数量会比较少，甚至可能出现没有幼仔的情况。”</seg>

        <seg id="10">我国藏羚羊保护专家、陕西省动物研究所（西北濒危动物研究所）研究员吴晓民说：“藏羚羊回迁是雌性藏羚羊结束产仔后，陆续带着幼仔回到栖息地的过程。起初离开产仔地的回迁群体较为庞大，但随后藏羚羊将根据不同的地理种群、沿不同路径回到它们各自的栖息地。”</seg>
        <seg id="11">为确保藏羚羊群安全回迁，记者了解到，日前三江源国家公园管理局长江源园区可可西里管理处已安排工作人员在主要回迁区域，持续开展视频监测和辖区巡逻。</seg>

        <seg id="3">Monitoring images from areas near the Wudaoliang Conservation Station show that on July 25th, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes leading 3 calves crossed Kilometer Marker 3002 on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, indicating that Tibetan antelopes have already begun their return migration.</seg>
        <seg id="4">According to experts, in recent years, Tibetan antelope calves have made up a fifth to a quarter of the total herd migrating along the return route.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Lian Xinming, associate researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Northwest Plateau Biology Institute said, “During the return migration season, Tibetan antelopes are at higher risk of being hunted, so the number of calves is low, and sometimes there are none at all. “</seg>
        <seg id="6">Statistics from the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration Yangtze River Origin Park Hoh Xil Management Office show that the number of Tibetan antelopes on the return migration route has been increasing each year, with 4,860 counted in 2019, an increase of 338 over 2018.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Lian Xinming said, “This year’s return migration of Tibetan antelopes is predicted to conclude in early September, and there is hope that the number will continue to rise. “</seg>
        <seg id="8">The Tibetan antelope is a national Level 1 protected species.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Each year in late May, Tibetan antelopes from areas Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, the Altyn-Tagh mountain range in Xinjiang, and other areas migrate to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to breed and birth their calves.</seg>
        <seg id="10">According to Wu Xiaomin, a Chinese Tibetan antelope conservation expert and researcher at the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwestern Endangered Animals Research Institute), “The return migration of Tibetan antelopes is the process of female Tibetan antelopes leading their calves back to their original habitats after their birthing period. The herd that leaves the birthing ground is fairly large, but later, the Tibetan antelopes split into groups specific to different regions and return along separate routes to their original territories. “</seg>
        <seg id="11">This journalist learned that to ensure the safe return migration of Tibetan antelope herds, the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration Yangtze River Origin Park Hoh Xil Management Office has arranged personnel to conduct continuing video surveillance and patrols along the primary migration routes.</seg>
        <seg id="12">If a herd is discovered attempting to cross a highway, the mountain patrol teams respond rapidly with traffic control measures to drive herds safely through wildlife crossings, so that they are disturbed by humans as little as possible during their migration.</seg>

        <seg id="1">那么，日常生活中到底该如何解暑？</seg>
        <seg id="2">专家建议，夏日外出尽量避开高温时段，最好不要在中午前后在烈日下行走或劳动，因为这个时间段的阳光最强烈，发生中暑的可能性较高。</seg>
        <seg id="3">如果此时段必须外出，一定要做好防护工作，如打遮阳伞、戴遮阳帽、戴太阳镜，有条件的最好涂抹防晒霜，以防晒伤。</seg>
        <seg id="4">衣服尽量选用浅色、透气性好的棉、麻、丝类质地，少穿化纤品类服装，以免大量出汗时不能及时散热，引起中暑。</seg>
        <seg id="5">高温闷热天气时，要准备充足的水饮，及时饮用，不要等口渴了才喝水，因为一旦感觉口渴表示身体已经缺水了，每次喝水控制在150毫升至200毫升，喝温开水，不要喝冰水。</seg>
        <seg id="6">根据气温高低，一般人员每天喝1.5升至2升水，高温作业人员，每天喝3升至5升水。</seg>
        <seg id="7">出汗较多时可适当补充一些盐水，弥补人体因出汗而失去的盐分。</seg>
        <seg id="8">另外，夏季人体容易缺钾，使人感到倦怠疲乏，含钾茶水是极好的消暑饮品。</seg>
        <seg id="9">夏天多食含水量高的蔬果，如生菜、黄瓜、西红柿等；新鲜水果，如桃子、杏、西瓜、甜瓜等水分含量为80％至90％，都可以用来补充水分；乳制品既能补水，又能满足身体的营养之需。</seg>
        <seg id="10">此外，在高温环境中工作的人群，应适当补充含有钾、镁等元素的饮品。</seg>
        <seg id="11">夏天日长夜短，气温高，人体新陈代谢旺盛，消耗也大，容易感到疲劳。</seg>
        <seg id="12">充足的睡眠，可使大脑和身体各系统都得到放松，既利于工作和学习，也是预防中暑的措施。</seg>
        <seg id="13">专家称，最佳就寝时间是22时至23时，最佳起床时间是5时30分至6时30分。</seg>
        <seg id="14">睡眠时注意不要躺在空调出风口和电风扇下，以免患上空调病和热伤风。</seg>
        <seg id="15">专家建议，在户外活动或进行高温作业的人群，可随身携带十滴水、人丹、藿香正气水或藿香正气丸等防暑药品，或放置在就近工作场所，随时使用，以防发生中暑。</seg>

        <seg id="1">So, how should we deal with heat in our daily lives?</seg>
        <seg id="2">According to experts, you should avoid going outside during the hottest part of the day during summer and avoid walking or labor in the sun before or after noon, because these periods of the day are when the sun is most intense and the possibility of heatstroke is highest.</seg>
        <seg id="3">If you can’t avoid going outside during these periods, take protection measures such as carrying a parasol, wearing a sun hat, wearing sunglasses, and applying sunscreen when possible to prevent burns.</seg>
        <seg id="4">For clothing, light-colored, breathable cotton, linen, and silk are best, while chemical fiber clothing should be avoided to prevent heatstroke due to insufficient heat dissipation when sweating profusely.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In hot, humid weather, have sufficient water ready and drink it before you feel thirsty, because feeling thirsty means your body is already dehydrated, while also ensuring that each mouthful is between 150-200ml, and drink warm, boiled water instead of ice-cold water.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Depending on temperature, the average person drinks 1.5-2L of water per day, while workers in high-temperature environments drink 3-5L per day.</seg>
        <seg id="7">At times of profuse sweating, add some salt to the water to make up for the salt your body loses through sweating.</seg>
        <seg id="8">In addition, the human body tends to be deficient in potassium in summer, which makes people feel tired and depleted, so drinking potassium-infused tea is an excellent way to relieve yourself from the heat.</seg>
        <seg id="9">During summer, eat vegetables with high water content such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, as well as fresh fruit such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, and melons, all of which have water content between 80-90%, which is helpful for rehydration, while dairy products can both rehydrate and provide the body’s required nutrition.</seg>
        <seg id="10">People who work in high-temperature environments should also supplement their potassium, magnesium, and other nutrients with the appropriate beverages.</seg>
        <seg id="11">During the long days and short nights of summer, while temperatures are high, the body’s metabolism ramps up and consumes more calories, making it easy to feel tired.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Getting sufficient sleep relaxes brain’s and body’s systems, which is beneficial to both work and study, and is a good way to prevent heatstroke.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Experts say the best time to fall asleep is between 22:00-23:00, and the best time to wake up is between 05:30-06:30.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Take care not to lie under air-conditioning vents or electric fans while sleeping to avoid air-conditioning sickness and thermal colds.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Experts advise that people who exercise outdoors or work in high-temperature environments carry Shi Di Shui, Ren Dan, Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Shui, Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Wan, or other heatstroke prevention medicines to with them or place them around their work environment and use them often to prevent heatstroke.</seg>

        <seg id="1">我希望大家能花点时间考虑 一个非常简单的事实 那就是，到目前为止， 我们对宇宙的大部分了解 都来自于光。</seg>
        <seg id="2">我们站在地球上仰望夜空 用肉眼就能看到天上的繁星。</seg>
        <seg id="3">强烈的阳光是如此地刺眼，</seg>
        <seg id="4">我们能看到从月球反射回来的光，</seg>
        <seg id="5">自从伽利略将他那简陋的天文望远镜 瞄准宇宙中的天体， 时至今日，我们所了解的宇宙， 通过光呈现在我们眼前。</seg>
        <seg id="6">在现代天文望远镜的帮助下， 我们已经能够搜集 炫目无声的宇宙影像 – 这一系列影像 可以一直追溯到大爆炸。</seg>
        <seg id="7">不过，宇宙不是一部默剧， 因为宇宙并非真的寂静无声。</seg>
        <seg id="8">我想告诉大家 宇宙有着自己的配乐， 而宇宙自身正在不停地播放着。 因为太空可以想鼓一样振动。</seg>
        <seg id="9">所以当一些重大事情发生时 它能够向宇宙 发出一系列声音。</seg>
        <seg id="10">如今，我们希望能够 给这部关于宇宙的 宏伟的视觉作品 配上声音。</seg>
        <seg id="11">虽然我们从未听到过来自外太空的声音， 但我们应该能够在接下来的几年内， 把音量调大，听听那儿究竟发生了什么。</seg>
        <seg id="12">针对捕获宇宙声音 这个远大的目标， 我们将我们的重点 放在黑洞以及它所表现出的前景， 因为黑洞能够撞击时空 就像鼓槌撞击鼓面一样 发出非常特别的声音， 我也非常高兴给你们播放一些 我们预测的声音。</seg>
        <seg id="13">将来的某一天我们有可能可以看到一个影子 一个黑洞可以在一个非常明亮的背景上留下影子， 但目前还没被观测到。</seg>
        <seg id="14">尽管黑洞并不能被看到 但它们有可能被听到， 这是因为它们像鼓一样撞击时空。</seg>
        <seg id="15">宇宙能发出鼓一样声音的这个想法来自于 阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦，其实我们的很多想法都来自于他。</seg>
        <seg id="16">爱因斯坦意识到如果宇宙是空的， 如果宇宙是空的， 它将看起来像这幅照片一样， 除了那些画在上面的辅助线。</seg>
        <seg id="17">但如果我们在宇宙中自由落体， 即便没有这些辅助线， 我们的轨迹也会画出这些线， 因为我们将会发现我们沿着直线运动， 沿着不发生弯折的直线 穿过宇宙。</seg>
        <seg id="18">爱因斯坦还意识到－ 这可是真正最关键的部分（matter也有“物质”的意思）– 如果你在宇宙中放入能量和物质， 宇宙就会弯曲。 自由落体的物体 在经过向太阳这样的天体时 将会被偏转 沿着空间中被弯折的路径运动。</seg>
        <seg id="19">这就是爱因斯坦伟大的广义相对论。</seg>
        <seg id="20">甚至光的路径也会被弯折。</seg>
        <seg id="21">当弯折大到一定程度时 就会围绕着太阳运动的轨道转， 就像地球绕着太阳转，月球绕着地球转。</seg>
        <seg id="22">这是宇宙中自然的曲线。</seg>
        <seg id="23">不过爱因斯坦并没有意识到 如果你把太阳 压缩成直径6公里的球 – 也就是说你把相当于地球质量一百万倍的物质 压缩成直径6公里的球， 你将制造出一个黑洞， 这个物体的密度非常之大 以至于如果光离它太近，也将无法逃脱－ 在宇宙中留下一个巨大的黑影，</seg>
        <seg id="24">不过爱因斯坦一直认为黑洞只是一个数学奇点。</seg>
        <seg id="25">他并不相信真的存在黑洞。</seg>
        <seg id="26">他相信大自然会阻止黑洞的形成以保护我们。</seg>
        <seg id="27">人们在数十年之后 才开始使用“黑洞”这一名词 并且意识到 黑洞是真实存在的天体 – 事实上，它们是一些质量极大的恒星 在它们生命的终点 发生灾难性坍缩后的 死亡状态。</seg>
        <seg id="28">我们的太阳不会坍缩形成黑洞。</seg>
        <seg id="29">它的质量其实不足够大。</seg>
        <seg id="30">但是，如果我们做了一些思想实验 – 爱因斯坦非常喜欢这样做 – 我们可以假想 把太阳粉碎后压缩在六公里的范围内， 然后在围绕它的轨道上放一个小小的地球， 比如放在离黑洞太阳 30公里远的轨道上。</seg>
        <seg id="31">地球将自己发光， 因为现在太阳已经不见了，我们没有其他光源 – 因此，我们小小的地球得自己发光。</seg>
        <seg id="32">你会发现，你甚至可以把地球放在离黑洞 30公里外的轨道上 并且让它开心地绕轨道运行。</seg>
        <seg id="33">这个黑洞 其实只有差不多曼哈顿那么大。</seg>
        <seg id="34">在它摧毁地球之前， 它可能会膨胀到哈德森大街。</seg>
        <seg id="35">但基本上这就是我们在讨论的东西。</seg>
        <seg id="36">我们讨论的是一个被压缩到 曼哈顿一半那么大的一个物体。</seg>
        <seg id="37">所以我们把这个地球移动到离黑洞接近的地方 – 30公里处 – 我们注意到它沿着完美的轨道绕黑洞运行。</seg>
        <seg id="38">有一些传言 说黑洞将吞噬宇宙中的一切， 但实际上你必须离得非常近才会真的掉进去。</seg>
        <seg id="39">但令人印象深刻的是，从我们的角度来看， 我们总能看到地球。</seg>
        <seg id="40">它无法躲在黑洞后面。</seg>
        <seg id="41">从地球发出的光，一部分落入黑洞， 但还有一部分被黑洞弯折后被我们看到。</seg>
        <seg id="42">所以你不能在一个黑洞后面藏任何东西。</seg>
        <seg id="43">如果这是太空堡垒卡拉狄加中的剧情 而你正和赛昂人战斗， 不要躲在黑洞后面。</seg>
        <seg id="44">它们可以看到你。</seg>
        <seg id="45">我们的太阳不会坍缩成一个黑洞； 它的质量不够大， 但在我们的银河系中有数以万计的黑洞。</seg>
        <seg id="46">如果其中的一个在吞噬银河系， 它看上去将会是这个样子。</seg>
        <seg id="47">我们将会看到一个黑洞的影子 投在银河系中数千亿颗恒星 以及恒星照亮的尘埃带上。</seg>
        <seg id="48">如果我们坠向这个黑洞， 我们会看到光在黑洞周围被折射， 我们甚至在开始进入这个阴影的时候 完全不会感觉到一些巨大的变化正悄然发生。</seg>
        <seg id="49">如果我们试图启动火箭并离开那里，结果不会很好， 因为我们不可能逃离， 连光也不可能逃离。</seg>
        <seg id="50">虽然黑洞从外面看是漆黑的， 但是在里面看并非如此， 因为所有星系的光线都可以随着我们一起落入黑洞。</seg>
        <seg id="51">而且即便如此，由于相对论的时间膨胀效应， 我们的时钟相比银河系的时间而言 似乎变慢了， 这看起来就好像 外面的星系在加速变化， 就在我们自己被黑洞摧毁之前。</seg>
        <seg id="52">这就像体验濒临死亡的感觉， 你看到了隧道尽头的光明， 不过这可是一个完整的死亡体验。</seg>
        <seg id="53">（笑声） 你没有办法告诉任何人 你在隧道尽头看到了光明。</seg>
        <seg id="54">到目前为止，我们从来没有见过这样一个黑洞留下的阴影， 但黑洞可以被听到， 即使它们不能被看到。</seg>
        <seg id="55">想象一下，在一个真实的天文学景象里 – 想象两个已经一起存在了很长时间的黑洞。</seg>
        <seg id="56">也许它们以前是恒星 之后坍缩成了两个黑洞 – 每一个的质量都是太阳的10倍。</seg>
        <seg id="57">现在我们把它们压缩到60公里之内。</seg>
        <seg id="58">它们每秒可以 旋转数百次。</seg>
        <seg id="59">在生命的尽头， 它们以光速彼此靠近。</seg>
        <seg id="60">在几分之一秒内 就能穿越了数千公里。 在这个过程中，它们不仅会使空间发生弯曲， 还会在身后的尾流中 造成空间的振动， 一种真实存在的时空波。</seg>
        <seg id="61">黑洞在和宇宙 发生撞击的时候 使得空间发生挤压和拉伸。</seg>
        <seg id="62">这些振动以光速 在太空中传播。</seg>
        <seg id="63">这个计算机模拟是 由国家航空航天局戈达德的相对论组完成的。</seg>
        <seg id="64">解决这个问题前后花了近30年的时间。</seg>
        <seg id="65">这是众多小组中的一个。</seg>
        <seg id="66">它展示了两个黑洞围绕着对方转动， 这些是想象中的曲线。</seg>
        <seg id="67">正如你所看到的 – 可能有些模糊 – 你能看到由红色的波被发射出来， 这些就是引力波。</seg>
        <seg id="68">它们是实实在在的宇宙的声音， 这些声音将在黑洞相互融合的过程中 以光速从这些黑洞向外传播， 直到这两个黑洞融为一体 成为一个安静地旋转着的黑洞。</seg>
        <seg id="69">如果你站得足够近， 你的耳朵会与 这些空间的挤压和拉伸产生共鸣。</seg>
        <seg id="70">你真的能够亲耳听到这些声音。</seg>
        <seg id="71">当然，你会无助地发现你的头也被挤压和拉伸， 所以你可能无法理解究竟发生了什么。</seg>
        <seg id="72">不过我愿意为你们播放一下 我们预测的声音。</seg>
        <seg id="73">这是我的小组的研究成果 - 一个相对简略的计算模型。</seg>
        <seg id="74">想象一个质量较小的黑洞 落入一个质量较大的黑洞。</seg>
        <seg id="75">你听到的声音 来自小质量黑洞在靠近大质量黑洞的过程中 与空间发生的碰撞。</seg>
        <seg id="76">如果它们距离很远，声音会非常小。</seg>
        <seg id="77">但渐渐的声音变得像一个鼓槌 敲打着空间， 让空间像鼓一样发生振动。</seg>
        <seg id="78">我们可以预测这个声音会变成什么样。</seg>
        <seg id="79">我们知道，在坠落的过程中， 小质量黑洞会越来越快，发出的声音也更响亮。</seg>
        <seg id="80">最终， 我们将听到小黑洞完全掉进了大黑洞。</seg>
        <seg id="81">我从来没觉得这声音有这么响 - 在这儿它实际上被放大了。</seg>
        <seg id="82">在家里听的时候，觉得这声音有些不给力。</seg>
        <seg id="83">听起来就像，叮，叮，叮。</seg>
        <seg id="84">这是我们研究小组模拟的另一个声音。</seg>
        <seg id="85">我在这儿并不会给大家展示图像， 因为黑洞不会留下 任何有用的踪迹， 真正的空间也不会向你展示 那些虚拟的曲线。</seg>
        <seg id="86">不过如果你在宇宙中度假的时候 听到这个声音， 我建议你赶快跑。</seg>
        <seg id="87">（笑） 最好赶快远离这声音。</seg>
        <seg id="88">这两个黑洞都在移动。</seg>
        <seg id="89">两个黑洞在向彼此靠近。</seg>
        <seg id="90">在这种情况下，它们都在猛烈地摇晃。</seg>
        <seg id="91">然后，它们将融为一体。</seg>
        <seg id="92">那个尖锐的声音是黑洞融合的标志 - 融合结束的时候就会发出尖锐的响声。</seg>
        <seg id="93">这是我们对我们将会看到的东西 所做出的预测。</seg>
        <seg id="94">幸运的是我们在加州长滩非常安全。</seg>
        <seg id="95">毋庸置疑，在宇宙的某个地方两个黑洞 已经融合在一起。</seg>
        <seg id="96">同样毋庸置疑的是，我们周围的空间 也能感受到这些穿越一百万光年的， 或者说来自一百万年前的振动， 它们以光速传播并最终与我们相遇。</seg>
        <seg id="97">但这些声音太小，以至于我们根本听不到。</seg>
        <seg id="98">世界上有些实验需要耗费很多心血才能搭建起来 – 其中有一个叫LIGO的的实验 - 它将能检测到 每四公里的距离上 小于一个原子核范围的 空间振动。</seg>
        <seg id="99">这是一个非常大胆的尝试， 它的灵敏度在未来几年里 将不会被超越 - 它将用来检测空间振动。</seg>
        <seg id="100">另外一个关于宇宙的研究项目 有望在未来十年内启动， 这个项目叫LISA。</seg>
        <seg id="101">LISA将可以看到超大质量的黑洞 - 那些质量是太阳的 几百万倍甚至几十亿倍的黑洞。</seg>
        <seg id="102">从哈勃望远镜传回的图像里，我们看到这两个星系。</seg>
        <seg id="103">看起来它们像是静止地拥抱在一起。</seg>
        <seg id="104">它们的中心可能分别存在着 一个质量巨大的超级黑洞。</seg>
        <seg id="105">但它们并非静止不动， 实际上它们正在融合。</seg>
        <seg id="106">这两个黑洞将发生碰撞， 它们的融合将经历数十亿年的时间。</seg>
        <seg id="107">因此搜集它们发出的声音 已经超出了我们人类的感知极限。</seg>
        <seg id="108">但LISA可以看到 两个在很早之前就开始 发生融合的超大质量黑洞的最后阶段， 也就是它们融合前的15分钟。</seg>
        <seg id="109">这种探测并不只限于黑洞， 它还能用来探测宇宙中任何大的扰动 - 其中最大的扰动要数“宇宙大爆炸”了。</seg>
        <seg id="110">当这个词语被创造出来的时候，有些人嘲弄说 - “噢，谁会相信宇宙大爆炸？”</seg>
        <seg id="111">这个有我在Proton Studios的朋友制作的动画短片 展示了从外部观看大爆炸的情景。</seg>
        <seg id="112">我们其实绝不会愿意真的这样；我们希望置身于宇宙的内部， 因为根本不存在置身宇宙之外这样的情况。</seg>
        <seg id="113">所以，想象一下你置身于大爆炸之中。</seg>
        <seg id="114">宇宙无处不在，世间万物都环绕在你的周围， 空间在无序地摇摆。</seg>
        <seg id="115">140亿年过去了， 而这声音依然萦绕在我们身边。</seg>
        <seg id="116">星系逐渐形成， 一批一批的恒星在星系中形成。 在某个星球上， 至少存在一个这样的星球， 适合生命居住。</seg>
        <seg id="117">在这里，我们疯狂地搭建实验， 做计算，写计算机代码。</seg>
        <seg id="118">想象一下，十亿年前， 两个黑洞相撞。</seg>
        <seg id="119">这声音一直以来 都在时空中穿梭。</seg>
        <seg id="120">我们甚至都没出现在这里。</seg>
        <seg id="121">它越来越近 - 40,000年前，我们还在洞穴的石壁上画画。</seg>
        <seg id="122">如果我们所要获取的声音是宇宙大爆炸发出的， 它听起来会像这样。</seg>
        <seg id="123">严格地讲，它就是噪声。</seg>
        <seg id="124">这是一种白噪声，一种混乱的铃声。</seg>
        <seg id="125">但它在我们周围无处不在， 只要它没有被宇宙中的 某些其他过程所抵消的话。</seg>
        <seg id="126">如果我们能够探测到这些声音，对我们的耳朵来说这将像音乐一般， 因为这安静的回声 来自于我们被创造的瞬间， 来自于我们抬头遥望的宇宙。</seg>
        <seg id="127">因此在未来的几年里， 我们将能把这些配乐的音量调大一点点， 让宇宙以音频的形式呈现给我们。</seg>
        <seg id="128">但是，如果我们能够探测到那些最早的瞬间， 它还将使我们 离理解大爆炸更进一步， 使我们能够去追问一些最为困难， 同时也最为飘渺的问题。</seg>
        <seg id="129">如果我们倒着播放宇宙的历程， 我们可以知道过去曾有过一次大爆炸， 我们甚至可以听到它那吵杂的声音， 但我们的大爆炸是宇宙中唯一的大爆炸吗？</seg>
        <seg id="130">我的意思是我们不禁会问，在那之前有没有发生过类似的大爆炸呢？</seg>
        <seg id="131">将来会不会再次发生呢？</seg>
        <seg id="132">我想说如果把这个问题的意义上升到 TED所倡导的引发人们重新思考的这个层面， 至少在这最后一分钟里，我们可以提出一些问题， 那些我们确实可能永远也回答不了的问题。</seg>
        <seg id="133">但我们不禁要问： 我​们的宇宙会不会 只是一部更宏大的历史中的一段插曲？</seg>
        <seg id="134">又或者说，我们会不会只是多元宇宙中的一个分支 – 每个分支都曾经历过自己的大爆炸 – 也许它们中的一些存在嗡嗡作响的黑洞， 也许有些没有 – 也许一些存在有意识的生命，也许有些不存在 – 它们不属于我们的过去，也不存在于我们的未来， 而是以某种方式与我们联系在一起？</seg>
        <seg id="135">因此，我们忍不住会猜测，如果存在一个多元宇宙， 在这个多元宇宙中的其他分支中， 存在生命吗？</seg>
        <seg id="136">这是我们这个多元宇宙中生命。</seg>
        <seg id="137">多元宇宙中是否还有其他生命， 他们会不会也在猜测我们的存在， 思考着他们自己的起源？</seg>
        <seg id="138">如果是这样的， 我能想象他们与我们一样， 做计算，编写计算机代码， 搭建实验仪器， 试图探测那些 来自于他们起源时的微弱声音， 并怀疑还有谁在那里。</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light.</seg>
        <seg id="2">We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The Sun burns our peripheral vision.</seg>
        <seg id="4">We see light reflected off the Moon.</seg>
        <seg id="5">And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history.</seg>
        <seg id="6">And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition.</seg>
        <seg id="11">And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.</seg>
        <seg id="12">So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.</seg>
        <seg id="13">We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet.</seg>
        <seg id="14">And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.</seg>
        <seg id="17">But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.</seg>
        <seg id="19">It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Now even light will be bent by those paths.</seg>
        <seg id="21">And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These are the natural curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="23">What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.</seg>
        <seg id="25">He did not believe they existed in nature.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He thought nature would protect us from their formation.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It's actually not massive enough.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun.</seg>
        <seg id="31">And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.</seg>
        <seg id="32">And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="33">This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.</seg>
        <seg id="34">It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But basically that's what we're talking about.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan.</seg>
        <seg id="37">So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="38">There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in.</seg>
        <seg id="39">But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="40">It cannot hide behind the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="41">The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.</seg>
        <seg id="42">So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="43">If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They can see you.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.</seg>
        <seg id="46">And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.</seg>
        <seg id="48">And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.</seg>
        <seg id="49">It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.</seg>
        <seg id="50">But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.</seg>
        <seg id="51">And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.</seg>
        <seg id="53">(Laughter) And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="57">So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.</seg>
        <seg id="58">They can be spinning hundreds of times a second.</seg>
        <seg id="59">At the end of their lives, they're going around each other very near the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="60">So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="63">This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.</seg>
        <seg id="64">It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.</seg>
        <seg id="65">This was one of the groups.</seg>
        <seg id="66">It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves.</seg>
        <seg id="67">And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves.</seg>
        <seg id="68">They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day.</seg>
        <seg id="69">If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space.</seg>
        <seg id="70">You would literally hear the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.</seg>
        <seg id="72">But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict.</seg>
        <seg id="73">This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="75">The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.</seg>
        <seg id="76">If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.</seg>
        <seg id="77">But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="78">And we can predict what the sound will be.</seg>
        <seg id="79">We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.</seg>
        <seg id="80">And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.</seg>
        <seg id="82">At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.</seg>
        <seg id="83">It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.</seg>
        <seg id="84">This is another sound from my group.</seg>
        <seg id="85">No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves.</seg>
        <seg id="86">But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving.</seg>
        <seg id="87">(Laughter) Want to get away from the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Both black holes are moving.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Both black holes are getting closer together.</seg>
        <seg id="90">In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And then they're going to merge.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Now that's our prediction for what we'll see.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.</seg>
        <seg id="95">And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us.</seg>
        <seg id="97">But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.</seg>
        <seg id="98">There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers.</seg>
        <seg id="99">It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up.</seg>
        <seg id="100">There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA.</seg>
        <seg id="101">And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="102">In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.</seg>
        <seg id="103">They look like they're frozen in some embrace.</seg>
        <seg id="104">And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.</seg>
        <seg id="105">But they're not frozen; they're actually merging.</seg>
        <seg id="106">These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.</seg>
        <seg id="107">It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration.</seg>
        <seg id="108">But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together.</seg>
        <seg id="109">And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="110">When that expression was coined, it was derisive -- like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"</seg>
        <seg id="111">This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.</seg>
        <seg id="112">We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="113">So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="114">It's everywhere, it's all around you, and the space is wobbling chaotically.</seg>
        <seg id="115">Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us.</seg>
        <seg id="116">Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in those galaxies, and around one star, at least one star, is a habitable planet.</seg>
        <seg id="117">And here we are frantically building these experiments, doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided.</seg>
        <seg id="119">That song has been ringing through space for all that time.</seg>
        <seg id="120">We weren't even here.</seg>
        <seg id="121">It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.</seg>
        <seg id="122">If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this.</seg>
        <seg id="123">It's literally the definition of noise.</seg>
        <seg id="124">It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.</seg>
        <seg id="125">But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe.</seg>
        <seg id="127">So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio.</seg>
        <seg id="128">But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.</seg>
        <seg id="129">If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?</seg>
        <seg id="130">I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?</seg>
        <seg id="131">Will it happen again?</seg>
        <seg id="132">I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.</seg>
        <seg id="133">But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history?</seg>
        <seg id="134">Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us?</seg>
        <seg id="135">So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures?</seg>
        <seg id="136">Here's my multiverse creatures.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins?</seg>
        <seg id="138">And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Thank you. Thank you.</seg>

        <seg id="2">During the “cloud graduation” season, a rare offline graduate art exhibition will open this weekend.</seg>
        <seg id="3">It will not open in art galleries, nor on the school campus, but in the public space of Joy City in Chaoyang District, is free to the general public, and will last to August 23.</seg>
        <seg id="4">This journalist learned that the art exhibition for 2020 graduates has 50 art works from 57 young artists at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Communication University of China, and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, the exhibition space extends from 2F to 6F, and makes full use of the lighting housings in the building to display the graphic works, maximizing the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.</seg>
        <seg id="5">During the pandemic, this exhibition is of unique significance.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Ge Ping, the person in charge of art display at Chaoyang District Joy City, said “We are bringing the ‘online’ graduation exhibition offline again, and we also hope to make more people see young people’s self-exploration and understanding of the outside world to magnify the healing role of art upon the society and heart. ”</seg>
        <seg id="7">She said that the exhibited art works are from graduates from several art colleges, among which the works suitable for display in business spaces were especially selected; the formats range from easel painting and sculpture to new media equipment, interactive flash and VR panoramas, making it the year’s most numerous and diverse exhibition by far.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Among the works, Li Yunxiao created The First War of 2020 using a mixed machine and manual production process to express his feelings of the pandemic; Liu Jiaying created Sound Money using the Ethereum block chain, which discusses themes including “cryptocurrency”, “credit creation”, and “transactions”; Cat Forest by Zhang Jiaqi and Barriers by Qiu Daqiang both describe how animals always stay with people, from which we can see how young artists comprehend the relationship between human beings and animals; the work The Winter of Belief -- Gift by Zhu Zhongyu reminds young people that “even if you achieve great success in career, do not forget your primary inspirations, and always remain innocent and sincere. ”</seg>
        <seg id="9">Among the few graduates participating in the placement of the exhibition, Li Jingyin is from the Department of Sculpture at the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.</seg>
        <seg id="10">“I arrived in Beijing on July 7, and at the time I was a little worried about the pandemic, so took the nucleic acid test three days in advance, and I came here with alcohol pads and my test report. ”</seg>
        <seg id="11">His art work The Mysterious Yesterday is complex in its structure, and took a lot of work to produce.</seg>
        <seg id="12">At the same time, he also helped others to remedy defects in their art.</seg>
        <seg id="13">“I was busy with placement until 4:30 a.m. and then worked on correcting defects, and the schedule was so tight that I even forgot to take photos with the works, which is a bit sad. ”</seg>
        <seg id="14">He hoped that, after the pandemic, he could go to see the exhibition of their works with his classmates.</seg>

        <seg id="6">“所谓熔盐塔式光热发电，就是将太阳光通过镜面集中反射到吸热塔形成热能，再通过传统发电技术将热能转化为电能。”</seg>
        <seg id="7">中电哈密太阳能热发电有限公司副总经理张勇介绍说，其设计原理类似于中国西北地区农村使用的太阳灶，都要把太阳光聚集起来。</seg>
        <seg id="8">该发电场于2017年10月开工建设，去年底实现并网，占地6600亩，共计划安装14500块定日镜。</seg>
        <seg id="9">“相比传统太阳能发电技术，其最大优点是可将聚集的热能储存起来，在晚上也能发电。”</seg>
        <seg id="10">张勇说，该项目配置的13小时储热系统，可使发电机组保持连续稳定运行，不受光照变化影响；也可根据电网负荷峰谷需求，快速参与电网调峰。</seg>
        <seg id="11">该项目完全建成后，可实现年发电量1.98亿度，每年可节约标准煤6万多吨，减排二氧化硫60多吨、氮氧化物60多吨、烟尘约20吨、二氧化碳15多万吨，为当地提供源源不断的清洁能源。</seg>

        <seg id="3">CNS from Hami, Xinjiang, July 26 Xinjiang Ploughs in “Sunflower Fields” to Take Advantage of Clean Energy</seg>
        <seg id="4">Over 6,000 pentagon heliostats, 48 square meters each, lined up in circles like a field of silver sunflowers, turning with the sun and reflecting sunlight to the 200-meter heat absorption tower in the middle for power generation.</seg>
        <seg id="5">On the 25th, the reporter saw this view when visiting a CNEEC Hami molten salt tower solar power plant in Naomaohu Township of Yiwu County in Hami, Xinjiang.</seg>
        <seg id="6">“Molten salt tower solar power generation means to form thermal energy through specular concentrated sunlight reflection to the heat absorption tower, then turn the thermal energy into electricity through conventional power generation technology. ”</seg>
        <seg id="7">Zhang Yong , Vice GM of CNEEC Hami Solar Power Co., Ltd., said the design concept is similar to solar stoves used in Northwestern rural areas, which use concentrated sunlight.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Covering an area of 6,600 mu, the power plant, construction of which started in October 2017, was integrated into the grid at the end of last year, with a total of 14,500 heliostats ultimately to be installed.</seg>
        <seg id="9">“Compared to conventional solar power technology, its greatest advantage is to store collected thermal energy so that power generation can continue in the evening. ”</seg>
        <seg id="10">Zhang Yong said the 13-hour thermal storage system deployed at this project is not affected by sunlight changes, enabling continuous stable operation of the generator unit, and can also swiftly support power grid peak stabilization according to grid load peak and valley demands.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Annual power generation of the project will reach 198 million kwh when completed, saving over 60,000 tons of standard coal, cutting over 60 tons of sulfur dioxide emission, 60 tons of oxynitrides, 20 tons of dust and fumes, and over 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide while providing a steady flow of clean energy to the locals.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Aside from that, there is another silver sunflower field in Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant covers an area of over 2,300 mu, with 714 generators following the sun to always maintain a 90 degree right angle between sunlight and panels.</seg>
        <seg id="14">“We use dual-axis tracking CPV technology that through integrated controls, ensures all power generating equipment adjusts its angle to the altitude of the sun to maintain generating efficiency. ”</seg>
        <seg id="15">Duan Mengqi, head of the power plant, said in good lighting weather, this technology improves efficiency by 20% compared to conventional photovoltaic power generation.</seg>
        <seg id="16">In the first half of this year, the power plant generated over 7 million kwh of electricity and supplemented local power demand.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest demonstration park with the most comprehensive photovoltaic component types, and it currently hosts 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000kw.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In the first half of this year, it generated 110 million kwh, an increase of 6% compared to 2019.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Hami is one of the regions that has the best solar energy resources in China.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Its average annual solar radiation is over 6,200 MJ per square meter, with around 3,200 annual sunshine hours.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In recent years, Hami has focused on developing its photovoltaic industry and established “sunflower fields”.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Installed solar power capacity is over 2.5 million kw, and its power generation exceeded 1.4 billion kwh in the first half of the year, 14% year-on-year growth.</seg>
        <seg id="23">At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 photovoltaic plants connected to the grid, with an installed capacity of over 10 million kw.</seg>
        <seg id="24">This year’s power generation is expected to be 15 billion kwh, which can replace over 6 million tons of standard coal.</seg>

        <seg id="3">美媒揭开了美方无端要求中国关闭驻休斯敦总领馆的真相</seg>
        <seg id="4">24日，中国外交部通知美国驻华使馆，中方决定撤销对美国驻成都总领事馆的设立和运行许可，并对该总领事馆停止一切业务和活动提出具体要求，作为对美方21日突然要求中方关闭驻休斯敦总领馆的反制措施。</seg>
        <seg id="5">美国政府这一行为引发多方关注，其政治动机遭到了外媒和学者的质疑。</seg>
        <seg id="6">为何要求中方关闭总领馆？</seg>
        <seg id="7">多家外媒称，尚不清楚为何美国会选中中国驻休斯敦总领馆，但对于这一举动的目的，外媒直言不讳地表示：为了大选。</seg>
        <seg id="8">美国有线电视新闻网(CNN)23日报道称，美方要求中方关闭驻休斯敦总领馆的举动引发民众对其政治动机的质疑。</seg>
        <seg id="9">文章称，美国政府对新冠疫情灾难性的应对，造成了总统特朗普在大选前的民调支持率较为低迷。</seg>
        <seg id="10">白宫官员私下称，对中国采取的强硬策略是为了挽救特朗普的支持率，同时也是为了转移白宫疫情应对失败的责任。</seg>
        <seg id="11">文章认为，中国驻休斯敦总领馆是美国选择的一个“受政治驱动、非常谨慎的”目标，美国政府选中它是“为了制造强硬的态度，同时避免造成重大冲突的风险”。</seg>
        <seg id="12">英国广播公司(BBC)也认为，在美国大选季来临、美国经济受到疫情严重打击之际，特朗普认为“打‘中国牌’具有政治优势”。</seg>
        <seg id="13">目前的状况是“一场螺旋式上升的、针锋相对的斗争”，这在一定程度上是由美国政府从国内考量的角度推动的，只会使中美之间的紧张关系更加恶化。</seg>
        <seg id="14">美国哥伦比亚广播公司(CBS)报道称，特朗普的连任前景因疫情暴发而承压，他一再因疫情而指责中国。</seg>
        <seg id="15">美国几乎每天都有针对特朗普所谓“中国剥削美国”荒谬论调的新行动。</seg>
        <seg id="16">“休斯敦总领馆在建立两国联系方面十分重要”</seg>
        <seg id="17">美联社评论称，美国要求中国关闭驻休斯敦总领馆加剧了世界上最大的两个经济体之间的紧张关系。</seg>
        <seg id="18">若关闭了中国驻休斯敦总领馆，除了外交方面的影响，位于美国南部的中国公民面临获得领事服务方面的困难，寻求签证和其他服务的美国公民也同样面临困难。</seg>
        <seg id="19">休斯敦一家商业团体对美方要求中国关闭驻休斯敦总领馆一事表示遗憾，称总领馆在建立两国贸易、投资和文化联系方面发挥了重要作用。</seg>
        <seg id="20">美联社认为，这反映出中国经济的重要性。</seg>
        <seg id="21">美国《外交政策》杂志网站认为，美方这一举动“是一系列挑衅性举措的一部分，这些举措只会让美中关系恶化”。</seg>
        <seg id="22">路透社援引美国智库布鲁金斯学会东亚问题专家乔纳森·波拉克的话称，自从美中两国1979年建立全面外交关系以来，他想不出任何举动能与美国针对中国驻休斯敦总领馆的这次行动来相提并论。</seg>
        <seg id="23">香港《南华早报》报道称，美方这一举动在中美两国40余年外交关系中是前所未有的。</seg>

        <seg id="3">U.S. Media Unveils U.S. Unwarranted Demand to Shut Down Chinese Consulate General In Huston</seg>
        <seg id="4">On the 24th of this month, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notifies United States’ Embassy to China that it decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and outlines specific requirements to shut down all businesses and activities of the Consulate General in response to the sudden U.S. request to shut down the Chinese Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.</seg>
        <seg id="5">This action taken by the United States government has drawn broad attention, and its political motivation is questioned by foreign media and scholars.</seg>
        <seg id="6">What is the reason behind the demand for the Chinese Consulate General shutdown?</seg>
        <seg id="7">Several foreign media reported that the reason why the U.S. would select the Chinese Consulate General in Huston is unclear, but as to the purpose of this action, they stated straightforwardly that it was “for the election”.</seg>
        <seg id="8">According to a CNN report on the 23rd, the request to shut down the Chinese Consulate General in Houston made people question the United States’ political motives.</seg>
        <seg id="9">As the article states, U.S. government’s disastrous response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to President Trump’s sluggish support rate in polls prior to the election.</seg>
        <seg id="10">White House officials’ private statements indicate that the tough position against China is to save Trump’s support rate as well as to shift the focus away from the White House’s failure in response to the pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The article believes Chinese Consulate General in Houston to be a “politically motivated and discreet” target chosen by the U.S. “to create a tough position while avoiding major conflicts”.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The BBC also believes that with the U.S. election around the corner and the U.S. economy suffering badly due to the pandemic, Trump sees “playing the ‘China card’ as politically beneficial”.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The current situation is a “spiraling tit for tat fight”, which, driven by U.S. government’s domestic considerations to some extent, will only worsen tensions between China and the U.S.</seg>
        <seg id="14">According to CBS, Trump’s prospects for a second term is under pressure because of the pandemic, and he has repeatedly pointed his finger at China for the outbreak.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The U.S. has almost daily new actions based on Trump’s absurd argument of so-called “China’s exploitation of the United States”.</seg>
        <seg id="16">“The Consulate General in Huston is important for building bilateral connections”</seg>
        <seg id="17">As stated by the AP, the U.S. request to shut down Chinese Consulate General will aggravate tensions between two of the world’s largest economies.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Besides the diplomatic impact, with the Chinese Consulate General in Houston shut down, Chinese citizens in the South will face difficulties accessing consular services, and so will U.S. citizens applying for visas or other services.</seg>
        <seg id="19">A business group in Huston expressed its regrets on this matter, saying the Consulate General plays a key role in bilateral trade, investment, and cultural connections.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The AP believes that it reflects the importance of China’s economy.</seg>
        <seg id="21">According to the Foreign Policy website, this action by the U.S. is “part of a series of provocative moves that will only aggravate U.S.-China relations”.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, East Asia expert of Brookings Institution, saying he couldn’t think of anything comparable to the United States action on the Chinese Consulate General in Houston since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979.</seg>
        <seg id="23">The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong calls the U.S. action unprecedented in the 40 years of China-U.S. diplomatic relations.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Analysts believe this action could cause lasting damage.</seg>
        <seg id="25">The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 as the first Chinese Consulate General opened in the United Stated.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Currently, China has one Embassy and five Consulate Generals in the United States.</seg>

        <seg id="2">URUMQI, July 26 (Ecns.cn, by Sun Tingwen, Zhao Yaomin): Zhang Wei, director of the Municipal Health Commission of Urumqi, reported on the state of the latest outbreak of pandemic and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi on the 26th, saying that at present, free nucleic acid testing work has been basically completed in most areas of Urumqi.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are making further assessments of the development of the pandemic based on the results of the nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the pandemic situation and its prevention and control in Xinjiang.</seg>
        <seg id="5">According to him, there were 22 new confirmed COVID-19 cases in Urumqi from 0:00 to 24 on July 25 (including 5 confirmed asymptomatic cases), and 38 new asymptomatic cases.</seg>
        <seg id="6">As of 24:00 on July 25, 135 cases were confirmed in Urumqi and 147 were asymptomatic.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The newly-added asymptomatic cases on the 25th were also basically discovered through free nucleic acid testing in the city.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Zhang Wei, director of the Municipal Health Commission of Urumqi, reported that free nucleic acid testing work has basically been completed in most areas of Urumqi.</seg>
        <seg id="9">He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as sensitivity of detection reagents, infection time and detoxification time of the tested people, cooperation of the tested people when the samples are taken (low level of cooperation may lead to failure to take the specimen), as well as the detection environment and the proficiency of the inspectors.</seg>
        <seg id="10">For various reasons, false negative results can also appear in nucleic acid testing.</seg>
        <seg id="11">False negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the results of the nucleic acid test are negative.</seg>
        <seg id="12">In addition, for those who have close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, it usually takes two nucleic acid tests to exclude them.</seg>
        <seg id="13">For those who have been to the high-risk areas for the pandemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, there may be a possibility of false negatives in nucleic acid testing, so another nucleic acid test is needed.</seg>
        <seg id="14">He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, Urumqi would carry out two free nucleic acid tests in key areas such as Tianshan district and Saybag district, and carry out the work of “making up for deficiencies".</seg>
        <seg id="15">It is reported that Tianshan district and Saybag district are high-risk epidemic areas.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Fauci made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on July 25th.</seg>
        <seg id="3">He warned that it was not clear how COVID-19 would develop in the autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the pandemic would be, saying, "The only way to end all this is that we all choose to be part of the solution."</seg>
        <seg id="4">According to data from Johns Hopkins University, as of 21:00 on July 25th, the number of confirmed cases in the United States was 4.176 million, with 146,000 deaths.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Fauci said some parts of the United States were struggling with a pandemic resurgence.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Although the pandemic situation varies from place to place and needs to be dealt with according to local conditions, diversified anti-pandemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between them.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The pandemic situation in one area will eventually affect other areas.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"This is not the time for complacency," Fauci said, "We have not finished our work, so we must step up our efforts and be alert regarding the uncertainty of the future. ”</seg>
        <seg id="9">David Ho, a Chinese American medical expert and the founder of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) for AIDs treatment, pointed out at the conference that COVID-19 in the US had not yet reached its peak.</seg>

        <seg id="11">David Ho called on the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for the research and development of COVID-19 treatment drugs and vaccines.</seg>

        <seg id="2">According to a report from Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post on the 25th which cited an anonymous source, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who heads China's trade negotiation team, and US trade representative Lighthizer, who is co-leader of the US team, are expected to hold formal talks in August to review the implementation of the first phase of the bilateral trade agreement.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Although China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products over the past few months, it still falls short of the amounts pledged under the trade agreement because of factors such as COVID-19 epidemic, the report said.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Analysts said that the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, could undermine any progress in the trade between the two sides.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The first phase of the trade agreement, which took effect a month after it was signed on Jan 15, stipulates that high-level trade framework groups from both sides should hold talks every six months.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The meeting will be "an important turning point" for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement, according to an insider.</seg>
        <seg id="7">But the person added that if the tense relations between the United States and China lead to low willingness to hold talks at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lighthizer and Liu He meets the trade agreement's requirement to meet every six months.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Relations between China and the United States have deteriorated sharply this year, with disputes over the origin of COVID-19, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology.</seg>
        <seg id="9">US President Donald Trump, who boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the deal at the start of the year, has recently changed his attitude.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Although China has been breaking the record for amounts of US corn and soybeans bought in a single day, "This trade deal doesn't mean as much to me now as it did when it was reached," he said at a White House press conference on 23th.</seg>
        <seg id="11">An anonymous Chinese government adviser also agreed that a new round of trade talks was unlikely because of the poor relations between the US and China and that "trade issues have lost weight in the Sino-US relationship."</seg>
        <seg id="12">However, he revealed that China's economic and trade agencies still held a meeting on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."</seg>
        <seg id="13">Jacob Parker, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said that it was "more important than ever" to maintain momentum on the first-phase agreement, and pointed out that China has made progress in further opening its financial market to US enterprises this year.</seg>

        <seg id="2">经济观察网 记者 张斌 因为瑞幸咖啡造假事件，美国市场对中概股实施更加严厉的监管，加上估值长期承压，在美国上市的中概股备感压力，网易、京东等中概股近期纷纷开启回港上市征途。</seg>
        <seg id="3">而近期贝壳、理想汽车等公司，赴美上市热情高涨。</seg>
        <seg id="4">疫情和中概股危机之下，现在是中国企业赴美上市的最好时间点吗？</seg>
        <seg id="5">“就近期的IPO案例以及接下来要赴美上市的公司情况而言，赴美IPO本质上没受到任何影响，反而现在市场非常好，甚至现在这个时间点是过去10年中国公司赴美IPO最好的时间节点 。”</seg>
        <seg id="6">纳斯达克证券交易所中国区首席代表郝毓盛在由雪球主办的“2020年上市公司领袖峰会中概股分会”上表示。</seg>
        <seg id="7">今年4月，美国证监会（SEC）和美国公众公司会计监管委员会（PCAOB）发布《关于审计质量和监管获取审计和其他国际信息的重要作用声明 — — 关于在中国有大量业务的美国上市公司当前信息获取的挑战讨论》 。</seg>
        <seg id="8">这份声明表示，虽然近年来的国际合作和协调显著增加，但美国监管部门在信息获取方面的问题依旧存在，SEC和PCAOB仍然面临法律和实践的挑战；与该文件相对应的是，PCAOB网站详细列出遭遇审计障碍的上市公司名单及其审计机构，大量中概股公司在列。</seg>
        <seg id="9">此外，今年5月，美国国会参议院通过《外国公司问责法案》，对外国公司在美上市提出额外的信息披露要求。</seg>
        <seg id="10">在郝毓盛看来，中概股危机并未影响投资人的胃口。</seg>
        <seg id="11">“这个消息刚出来的时候引起所有人的恐慌，大家都在问未来还能不能去美国上市了，但后来我们发现这些问题在投资人那边不是事，投资人在最近赴美IPO的路演时可能会问到这些问题，甚至成为标准化的问题，但这并没有被投资人当作投与不投一家中国公司的重要因子。</seg>
        <seg id="12">建议大家对目前的形势尽量以一颗平常心看待。</seg>
        <seg id="13">当然这次表面看起来可能是过去两年里最严重的情况，但就投资人的胃口而言，没有受到任何影响。</seg>
        <seg id="14">所以接下来从现在到今年底或美国大选前，赴美IPO的热潮还会持续。”</seg>
        <seg id="15">今年5月9日，金山云正式在美国纳斯达克上市，成为疫情后第一家赴美IPO的中国企业。</seg>
        <seg id="16">“金山云的上市给后面准备IPO的中国公司非常大的信心。”</seg>
        <seg id="17">郝毓盛表示。</seg>
        <seg id="18">雪球发布的2020上半年中概股数据报告显示，今年上半年，赴美IPO中国企业共计20家，较去年同期增长17.6% ； 从首发募资总额来看，20家企业总计筹资27.25亿，相比去年同期有所回升，涨逾52.4% ； 在行业分布上，今年上半年医疗保健行业IPO数量突出，较去年同期增长100% 。</seg>
        <seg id="19">据郝毓盛介绍，今年上半年赴美IPO的中国公司质量较高，有过硬的基本面和成长性的优质公司，会更能得到投资人的青睐。</seg>
        <seg id="20">从短期、中期、长期来看，郝毓盛对明中国公司赴美IPO继续持乐观态度。</seg>
        <seg id="21">“短期就是赴美IPO的热潮还在持续；中期就是中国公司有更多选择，A股、港股、美股，大家会把美国大选和中美关系作为市场选择和时间选择的考量因素；长期来看，一切都会恢复到常态，市场的波动都是周期，既有政治上的周期，也有经济上的周期，最终都会回归到正常阶段，股市历来都是波动前行的。”</seg>
        <seg id="22">郝毓盛同时表示，“今年不确定因素比较多，但对于优质公司来说，无论市场好与差，只要自己是扎实的并且有能让投资人看到的成长性，其他因素就都是相对次要的，投资人需要投资优秀的中国公司。”</seg>

        <seg id="2">www.eeo.com.cn - Reporter - Zhang Bin - The US market has begun supervising China concept stocks more closely due to the Luckin Coffee fraud incident, and this, paired with long-term pressure on valuations, have increased the pressure faced by Chinese concept stocks in the American market, causing several companies such as NetEase and JD.com to begin the process of migrating their primary listing location to Hong Kong.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Meanwhile, companies such as Shell and Ideal Auto have recently expressed enthusiasm about listing in the US market.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Given the epidemic and the crisis for China concepts stocks, is now the best time for Chinese companies to hold IPO’s in the US?</seg>
        <seg id="5">“Several recent examples of IPO’s and the state of companies that plan to go public in the US soon show us that the basic nature of American IPO’s have not changed, in fact the current market is very good, likely the best time in the past decade for Chinese companies to stage IPO’s. “</seg>
        <seg id="6">These were the words of Hao Yusheng, NASDAQ Chief Representative for the China Region, at Xueqiu’s “2020 Listed Company Leadership Summit China Concepts Stock Forum”.</seg>
        <seg id="7">In April of this year, the American Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Public Company Accounting Regulatory Board (PCAOB) stated, "Emerging Market Investments Entail Significant Disclosure, Financial Reporting and Other Risks; Remedies are Limited" listing certain risks that the disclosures by Chinese companies may be "incomplete or misleading."</seg>
        <seg id="8">According to the statement, despite the significant uptick in international cooperation in recent years, US regulators still have difficulty accessing information, and the SEC and PCAOB also face challenges on a legal and practical level; in addition to the statement, a detailed list of companies on the stock exchange which pose obstacles in their audits and their auditing agencies was posted on the PCAOB website, which included many Chinese concepts stock companies.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Beyond this, in May of this year, the US Senate passed the "Foreign Companies Accountability Act", which adds extra disclosure requirements for companies listed in the US.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Hao Yusheng believes the crisis for Chinese concepts stocks has not impacted the appetites of investors.</seg>
        <seg id="11">“Everyone panicked when the news first emerged, and wondered if they could list in the US in the future, but we soon discovered that this was not a problem for investors; investors will certainly encounter these new problems as they plan for their IPO’s, and these may even become standardized requirements, but these are not important factors for investors when they decide whether to invest in Chinese companies.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Everyone should try to remain calm about the current situation.</seg>
        <seg id="13">This may seem to be the most serious development in the last two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it hasn’t had any impact.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So, from now to the end of the year, or until the US presidential election, the surge in US IPO’s will continue. “</seg>
        <seg id="15">On May 9th, Kingsoft Cloud was officially listed on the NASDAQ in the US, making it the first Chinese company to stage its IPO in the US after the epidemic.</seg>
        <seg id="16">“The listing of Kingsoft Cloud should give Chinese companies getting ready for an IPO a lot of confidence, “</seg>
        <seg id="17">Hao Yusheng said.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Based on Xueqiu’s 2020 China Stocks Data Report, in the first half of the year, 20 Chinese companies had IPO’s in the US, a year-on-year increase of 17.6%; these 20 companies raised 2.725 billion yuan in initial funding, which was a rebound over last year, with a year-on-year increase of 52.4%; and industry distribution changed as well, with healthcare industry IPO’s especially prominent in the first half of the year, showing a year-on-year increase of 100%.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Hao Yusheng said it was primarily high-quality Chinese companies that sought IPO’s in the first half of the year, and that such high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and potential for growth are likely to become investor favorites.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about US IPO’s for Chinese companies, whether in the short, medium, or long term.</seg>
        <seg id="21">“In the short term, the surge of companies holding IPO’s in the US will continue; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options with A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and U.S. stocks, and factors such as the US election and China-US relations will be considerations for market and timing choices; in the long term, things should return to normal, with cyclical market fluctuations, both political and economic, ultimately returning to a normal state, because the markets have always fluctuated. “</seg>
        <seg id="22">At the same time, Hao Yusheng said, “There have been many factors of instability this year, but for the best companies, whatever market conditions may be, having a solid business and showing investors growth is more important than any other factors, so investors should choose high-quality Chinese companies. “</seg>

        <seg id="3">In Zhongtai Cluster, Liujing Village, Didi Township, Wulong District, the continued rainfall since July 22nd caused soil at the rear edge of the Zhongbao landslide to crack, leading a large area to deform and slide into the Wujiang tributary along the Cang River.</seg>
        <seg id="4">On the 25th, heavy rainfall in the area caused the landslide to expand, blocking the village road and completely obstructing the Cang River, forming a barrier lake with a water level of 13 meters behind the dam and a volume of an estimated 420,000 cubic meters.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Investigation and monitoring at the location show that the landslide’s volume was about 1.3 million cubic meters, and it remains unstable with occasional rockfalls; the barrier lake has overflowed the dam, and the danger of dike failure poses a risk to the village and power stations downstream.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Due to the danger, the local government evacuated residents along the river over the course of the night and moved people to safe areas.</seg>

        <seg id="4">保持战略定力，增强必胜信心，集中力量办好自己的事，是我们应对各种风险挑战的关键。</seg>
        <seg id="5">在近日召开的企业家座谈会上，习近平总书记强调，在当前保护主义上升、世界经济低迷、全球市场萎缩的外部环境下，我们必须集中力量办好自己的事，充分发挥国内超大规模市场优势，逐步形成以国内大循环为主体、国内国际双循环相互促进的新发展格局，提升产业链供应链现代化水平，大力推动科技创新，加快关键核心技术攻关，打造未来发展新优势。</seg>
        <seg id="6">察势者智，驭势者赢。</seg>

        <seg id="8">现在，疫情冲击下的世界正在经历深刻变化，面临更多不稳定不确定因素，经济全球化遭遇逆风和回头浪。</seg>
        <seg id="9">做好较长时间应对外部环境变化的思想准备和工作准备，推动我国经济乘风破浪、行稳致远，一个极为重要的方面就是，把扩大和满足国内需求作为发展的战略基点，充分发挥自身优势，通过繁荣国内经济、畅通国内大循环为我国经济发展增添动力，带动世界经济复苏。</seg>
        <seg id="10">我们要深刻认识到，构建完整的内需体系，关系我国长远发展和长治久安。</seg>
        <seg id="11">党中央审时度势，明确提出坚定实施扩大内需战略，这是应对疫情冲击的需要，是保持我国经济长期持续健康发展的需要，也是满足人民日益增长的美好生活的需要。</seg>
        <seg id="12">大国经济的优势就是内部可循环。</seg>
        <seg id="13">我国具有全球最完整、规模最大的工业体系、强大的生产能力、完善的配套能力，拥有1亿多市场主体和1.7亿多受过高等教育或拥有各类专业技能的人才，还有包括4亿多中等收入群体在内的14亿人口所形成的超大规模内需市场，正处于新型工业化、信息化、城镇化、农业现代化快速发展阶段，投资需求潜力巨大。</seg>

        <seg id="17">开放带来进步，封闭必然落后。</seg>

        <seg id="19">以国内大循环为主体，绝不是关起门来封闭运行，而是通过发挥内需潜力，使国内市场和国际市场更好联通，更好利用国际国内两个市场、两种资源，实现更加强劲更可持续的发展。</seg>
        <seg id="20">同时，扩大内需和扩大开放并不矛盾，国内循环越顺畅，越有利于构建开放新格局，越有利于形成参与国际合作和竞争新优势。</seg>

        <seg id="2">Beijing, July 25 (Xinhua) - People's Daily, July 26, Article of Commentator: Focus on Running Our Own Affairs and Create New Advantages for the Future Development</seg>
        <seg id="3">At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still serious and complex, and China faces unprecedented challenges in its development.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Maintaining strategic determination, strengthening our confidence to succeed, and concentrating on our own affairs are the keys for us to cope with all kinds of risks and challenges.</seg>
        <seg id="5">At the recent Entrepreneur Forum, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the face of an external environment characterized by rising protectionism, global economic downturn, and a shrinking international market, we need to pool resources and concentrate on managing the country's affairs well, and give full play to the advantage of a huge domestic market, so that a new pattern of development will gradually take shape, with domestic circulation playing a dominant role and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other, and as such, efforts should be made to elevate the modernization level of the industrial and supply chains, promote sci-tech innovation, speed up breakthroughs in core technologies, and foster new advantages for future development.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Those who observe the trends are wise, and those who follow the trends win.</seg>
        <seg id="7">In the external environment of the in-depth development of the economic globalization, putting both ends of market and resources on the world market have played an important role in China's rapid development.</seg>
        <seg id="8">At present, the world under the impact of COVID-19 is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization has encountered headwinds and undertows.</seg>
        <seg id="9">One of the most important aspects of making ideological and working preparations to cope with the changes in the external environment for a long time and promoting China's economy to ride the wind and waves and achieve steady development is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development and drive the global economic recovery by allowing the domestic economy to prosper and unblocking domestic circulation.</seg>
        <seg id="10">We must be fully aware that building a complete system of domestic demand is vital to China's long-term development and stability.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The CPC Central Committee assessed the situation and made it clear that it was necessary to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand in response to the impact of COVID-19, thereby maintaining the long-term, sustained, and healthy development of China's economy, and consistently meeting people's increasing demand for a better life.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The advantage of a large economy is internal circulation.</seg>
        <seg id="13">China has the world’s most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, and complete supporting capabilities; it has more than 100 million market entities and more than 170 million talents with higher education or professional skills; besides, the huge domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income consumers, is in the fast development stage of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, so the potential for investment demand is huge.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The basic economic systems, such as public ownership playing a leading role and all forms of ownership growing side by side, distribution according to labor as the main body with a variety of distribution methods coexisting, and the socialist market economy system can not only stimulate the vitality of all kinds of market entities and unleash and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic integration of efficiency and equity, and constantly realize common prosperity.</seg>
        <seg id="15">We should firmly grasp the strategic focus of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, define the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and achieve dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.</seg>
        <seg id="16">We should speed up the construction of a complete system of domestic demand, vigorously promote innovation in science, technology and other fields, and accelerate the development of strategic emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials to form more new areas and poles of growth, so that a new development pattern will gradually emerge whereby domestic circulation plays a dominant role and domestic and international circulations reinforce each other.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Opening up brings progress, while isolation is bound to leave one behind.</seg>
        <seg id="18">General Secretary Xi Jinping has stressed on many occasions that China will not close its door and will only open wider to the outside world.</seg>
        <seg id="19">With the domestic market as the mainstay, we are by no means operating behind closed doors; rather, we will leverage the potential of domestic demand to better connect the domestic and international markets, and make better use of both domestic and international markets and resources to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Meanwhile, expanding domestic demand and opening up are not in conflict with each other, because the smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive it will be to building a new pattern of opening up and creating new advantages for participating in international cooperation and competition.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Despite the rising trend of protectionism in the world, we must stay on the right side of history, deepen reform and opening-up, strengthen openness and cooperation in science and technology, promote an open world economy, and build a community with a shared future for mankind.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been overwhelmed; instead, its frustrations only give it the courage to grow stronger and rise up from its troubles.</seg>
        <seg id="23">On the way forward, China has the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the CPC, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, has the remarkable advantage of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, has powerful mobilization capabilities and powerful overall strength, and has the unity and struggle of the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups, meaning we can surely overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of good economic and social development, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and successfully embark on a new journey to fully build a modern socialist country!</seg>

        <seg id="4">有意思的是，“90后”更倾向于从一笔笔“小钱”开始攒，有六成平均每笔攒钱金额在20元以下… …</seg>
        <seg id="5">用余额宝攒钱，也成为“90后”的攒钱习惯。</seg>
        <seg id="6">数据显示，在7亿余额宝用户中，有1.34亿用户是“90后” 。</seg>
        <seg id="7">中国有1.74亿“90后” ，也就是说，全国每4个“90后”中约有3个在用余额宝攒钱。</seg>
        <seg id="8">目前，余额宝等货币基金的7日年化收益率从年初高于2%的水平，下滑到1.5%左右。</seg>
        <seg id="9">即使如此，也没有影响“90后”攒钱的步伐。</seg>
        <seg id="10">而在余额宝“攒钱效应”提升背景下，不少习惯使用余额宝的年轻人还直接转化为“基民”。</seg>
        <seg id="11">支付宝数据显示，截至7月13日，近一个月支付宝上的新“基民”同比增长1倍多，越来越多年轻人在支付宝上实现“进阶”理财。</seg>
        <seg id="12">有分析师认为，资金从余额宝流入股市，也是6月货币基金份额明确下滑的重要原因。</seg>
        <seg id="13">报告还显示，“90后”女生更倾向于多攒钱，平均比男生攒钱金额高两成；在支付宝平台上持有基金的用户中，6成是男性，女性与男性相比倾向于选择更为稳健的理财方式。</seg>

        <seg id="2">As Yu'E Bao's revenue declines, the "post-90s" generation has not given up using Yu'E Bao, but has instead begun to put money into it like crazy.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The "Yu'E Bao Savings Report of the Post-90s Generation" (2020 Edition) released by the China New Economic Research Institute with Alipay recently showed that in the first half of the year, the post-90s generation was more interested in saving money: the amount of savings per capita increased by nearly 40% over 2019.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Interestingly, the post-90s generation is more likely to start saving money with small sums, with 60% of them saving less than RMB 20 every time on average...</seg>
        <seg id="5">Putting money into Yu'E Bao has also become a habit of the post-90s generation.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Statistics show that 134 million of the 700 million Yu'E Bao users were born in the 1990s.</seg>
        <seg id="7">China has 174 million people born in the 1990s, which means that about three out of every four of the post-90s generation in the country are saving money with Yu'E Bao.</seg>
        <seg id="8">At present, the 7-day annualized yield of Yu'E Bao and other monetary funds has fallen to about 1.5% from higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Even so, this has not affected the pace of the post-90s generation saving money.</seg>
        <seg id="10">In the context of the increased "saving effect" of Yu'E Bao, many young people who are accustomed to Yu'E Bao have directly become "fund holders".</seg>
        <seg id="11">According to the data from Alipay, the number of new "fund holders" on Alipay has more than doubled in the past month as of July 13, with more and more young people achieving "advanced" financial management on Alipay.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Some analysts believe that funds flowing into the stock market from Yu'E Bao is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of monetary funds in June.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The report also shows that post-90s generation women are more likely to save more money than men, with the average amount of money saved by women being 20% higher than that of men, and among Alipay's fund holders, 60% are men, while women tend to choose more stable financial methods compared with men.</seg>
        <seg id="14">After saving their money, what are the plans of the post-90s generation?</seg>
        <seg id="15">According to Alipay, the post-90s generation has a habit of saving money for goals, and travel is the most popular goal for saving money.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Affected by the COVID-19, many in the post-90s generation have saved money to prepare for their post-epidemic travel; the resumption of cinema business also offers a new way to shift from saving to spending.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Florence Parly, Defense Minister of France, said on July 24 that France would invest further billions of euros into space defense to develop space military strength as a means to guard against other countries’ possible “unfriendly behavior” in the outer space.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Parly told La Provence that day that from 2019 to 2025, France’s budget for space military projects would increase to EUR 4.3 billion (USD 5 billion) from the previous EUR 3.6 billion (about USD 4.2 billion).</seg>
        <seg id="4">According to the France Military Budget Plan 2019-2025, approved in 2018 by the French Assembly, France is projected to update its existing observation satellites and communication satellites and launch three electromagnetic interception satellites to enhance the modernization level of its space monitoring radar.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Emmanuel Macron, President of France, announced in July last year that the French air force would establish a space military command post and “aviation and space armies” within itself.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Parly said that she would officially announce the establishment of the space army while inspecting a military college in Saron, Provence.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Parly said that the space army fell under the air force and by 2025, its authorized strength would reach 500.</seg>
        <seg id="8">She said “People previously perceived space as a place to serve for the common interests of science, but they don’t think that anymore. Space is a place where all major powers compete for global hegemony. ”</seg>
        <seg id="9">Parly reiterated Macron’s previous announcement, saying that France was not interested in arms race.</seg>
        <seg id="10">“We are not starting an arms race at all. But I am responsible for thoroughly acknowledging the possible threats we face. ”</seg>
        <seg id="11">Parly re-stated that the military satellite jointly used by France and Italy was spied on in 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="12">She said that the “secret watcher” was a Russian satellite.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Russia denied this.</seg>

        <seg id="15">French media holds the view that France’s efforts to establish its space military was caused by Donald Trump’s requirement for U.S. Department of Defense to draft bills to build a space force in February of last year.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Bill in December last year, approving the establishment of the sixth armed services branch in the United States, the Space Force.</seg>

        <seg id="2">本报讯（记者杨召奎）国家信息中心分享经济研究中心日前发布的《中国共享住宿发展报告2020》（以下简称《报告》）显示，受疫情冲击，2020年前5个月，我国共享住宿市场交易额同比下降72.1%。</seg>
        <seg id="3">不过，共享住宿市场自3月开始回暖，市场交易额、订单量和接待人数逐渐恢复。</seg>
        <seg id="4">《报告》显示，共享住宿市场交易额大幅下降，一方面是由于疫情防控下出行住宿需求大幅下降，订单量急剧减少，前5个月订单总量同比下降65%，接待人次同比下降63%；另一方面，需求的疲软也导致间夜价格出现了较为明显的下降，前5个月平均间夜价格同比下降16%。</seg>
        <seg id="5">不过，3月、4月、5月市场交易额环比分别增长78%、199%、35%；订单数环比分别增长141%、152%、50%；接待人次环比分别增长81%、112%、28%。</seg>
        <seg id="6">《报告》指出，共享住宿行业发展长期看好，但近期仍然存在诸多不确定性。</seg>
        <seg id="7">对此，国家信息中心分享经济研究中心副主任于凤霞对《工人日报》记者表示，共享住宿发展需要更有力的政策扶植，一方面需要做好前期已出台政策的落地实施，进一步加强政策宣贯，注重营造更好的营商环境；另一面还需要进一步从刺激消费需求、丰富旅游住宿服务供给、创新服务方式以及加强政府与平台企业合作等多个方面，进一步加大政策引导和扶持力度。</seg>

        <seg id="2">This news agency has reported (correspondent Yang Zhoukui) that, according to the “State of Shared Accommodation in China Report 2020” (abbreviated as “Report”) released by the State Information Center of China Sharing Economy Research Institute, thanks to the impact of the epidemic, the in the first 5 months of 2020, the number of transactions in China’s shared accommodation market declined by 72.1% year-on-year.</seg>
        <seg id="3">However, the shared accommodation market has started to recover since March, with the number of transactions, order volume, and number of guest stays gradually increasing.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The Report states that the sharp reduction in shared accommodation market transactions is caused, in part, by the sharp reduction in demand for travel accommodations due to epidemic control measures, which has drastically reduced order volume over the past 5 months; order volume is down by 65% year-on-year and guest stays are down by 65% year-on-year; meanwhile, it is also caused in part by a notable drop in per-night room prices due to decreased demand, which have declined an average of 16% year-on-year over the past 5 months.</seg>
        <seg id="5">However, in March, April, and May, the number of market transactions increased by 78%, 199%, and 35%, respectively; order volume increased by 141%, 152%, and 50%, respectively; and the number of guest stays increased by 81%, 112%, and 28%, respectively.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The Report points out that the shared accommodation market is promising in the long-term, but faces many uncertainties in the near term.</seg>
        <seg id="7">In response, Yu Fengxia, assistant director of the State Information Center of China Sharing Economy Research Institute, told a Workers’ Daily reporter that the shared accommodation market requires better policy support: on one hand, better implementation of previously issued policies and improved policy announcement channels to create a better business environment; as well as increased policy guidance and support through further stimulation of consumer demand, improved supply of tourism and accommodation services, innovative service models, improved government-to-platform/enterprise cooperation, and in many other aspects.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery department of the two hospitals formally establish the collaborative relationship, they will carry out remote consultation to work out real-time treatment plans with Changhai Hospital, staff will be sent for training and participating in weekly surgical technology exchanges and teaching visits organized by two hospitals; for complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to perform surgery at the hospital according to patients' needs, allowing patients in southwest Fujian to enjoy the top medical resources in China without leaving the province.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative scientific research on surgery, popularization of aortic disease, early screening, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="4">A special seminar on the aorta, organized by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by the Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was held in Xiamen on the same day.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The two famous hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held a signing ceremony for the cooperation center for vascular surgery at the same time, announcing the formation of the collaborative partnership to jointly improve the treatment of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The Vascular Surgery Department in Changhai Hospital of Shanghai is the only vascular surgery institute in the army and the only clinical medical center for vascular diseases in Shanghai, so as the first national key institute in the discipline of vascular surgery, the hospital has taken the lead in setting up the Chinese Medical Doctor Association's Specialist Committee on Endovascology, which is a leading and experienced team in this field.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of the Vascular Surgery Department in Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The Vascular Surgery Department in Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first vascular surgery department set up as an independent discipline in Fujian Province; it has long been dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases, and was approved as a provincial clinical key specialty in 2018.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In the treatment of aortic diseases, the hospital has vast experience in not only treating dissecting aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, but also the rupture of aortic aneurysms.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"Viewed from the diversity, difficulty, complication and other aspects of surgery, the vascular surgery department of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is outstanding in the region where it is located, which is why this cooperation center has been created to carry out all-round and in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and research in the diagnosis and treatment of lower extremity arteries, carotid arteries and other diseases not limited to the aorta, ”</seg>
        <seg id="11">said Professor Feng Rui, Deputy Director of Vascular Surgery Department at Changhai Hospital.</seg>
        <seg id="12">In 2018, the Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University and Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish the "Li Zhaoshen Famous Doctor Studio" in the Gastroenterology Department.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery Department, said in an interview with Ecns.cn that the hospital's vascular surgery department already has a long-term relationship with Changhai Hospital, and the formal collaborative relationship between the two hospitals can bring their cooperation and exchange to a deeper level.</seg>
        <seg id="14">He said that the hospital would regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical exchanges, teaching ward rounds, and discussions on difficult cases, weekly remote consultations are planned, and the department will also send staff for further training and exchanges to strengthen team cultivation and development.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The reporter learned at the seminar that vascular disease is the number one cause of death in China, and the aorta plays an important role as the main artery for all organs and the heart.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Aortic disease is often associated with high risks, high mortality, and complicated treatment; the thickest section of the aorta is 4cm in diameter, and once an aneurysm appears, followed by a rupture or intima rupture and dissecting aneurysm, it can lead to hemorrhage, which is very dangerous.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In recent years, as people's lifestyles change and the pace of life speeds up, China has become the leading country around the world for hypertension, and aortic disease cases has increased, so along with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic disease continues to be minimally invasive, rapid, and efficient.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Doctors can "reroute" the blood flow by puncturing the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta to avoid impact on the aneurysm or ruptured dissection and to achieve good results, and some cases can even be done with local anesthesia.</seg>
        <seg id="19">More than ten domestic experts were invited to the seminar to discuss new advances in the treatment of aortic disease, with cutting-edge technology training and discussion of difficult cases in the form of salons.</seg>

        <seg id="6">On the 25th, the Ministry of Water Resources pointed out that water levels remain high along the middle and lower Yangtze River, the Huaihe River’s flood peaks pass through the Bengbu section of Anhui, and on Lake Tai, the water level has been over warning levels for 28 days and over protection levels for 9 days, meaning that there is an extremely high risk of flooding, flood control work cannot be relaxed, and every aspect of flood defense must be done well.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Prevention work must also be carried out in the Southwest and North China regions where heavy rains are expected.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The Ministry of Water Resources has decided to maintain the L2 emergency flood and drought prevention measures.</seg>
        <seg id="9">At the request of the Jiangxi province and national flood and drought prevention and control departments and the Ministry of Emergency Management, 20 high-volume flood drainage vehicles were dispatched by firefighting and rescue corps in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang and the Fujian Longyan Qiaolong Emergency Equipment Company to help alleviate serious disasters in Jiangxi such as urban waterlogging and farmland flooding that result from such heavy rains.</seg>
        <seg id="10">On the 25th, all such heavy equipment arrived at the front lines of flood control and relief operations in Jiangxi.</seg>
        <seg id="11">As stipulated by the unified directive from local governments, the Ministry of Emergency Management Firefighting and Rescue Bureau Jiangxi Flooding Relief Front Line Command immediately ordered the Jiangxi Firefighting and Rescue Corps and assistance teams from neighboring provinces to establish 20 flood drainage teams for emergency flood drainage tasks in Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Shangrao in Jiangxi.</seg>
        <seg id="12">At the same time, the National Flood and Drought Prevention and Control Department and Ministry of Emergency Management made an emergency deployment from national reserves of 100 trailer pumps for flood control to support the flood relief and drainage work in Jiangxi.</seg>
        <seg id="13">At noon on July 25th, the Anhui Province Flood and Drought Prevention and Control Headquarters announced that emergency flooding measures would be in force for the relevant areas of the Yangtze River, Huaihe River, and Chaohu Basin in Anhui.</seg>
        <seg id="14">At 10:00 on July 25th, the Hefei City Disaster Prevention Committee announced that Hefei’s emergency disaster response would be increased to L2.</seg>
        <seg id="15">On July 25th, the Sichuan Province Flood and Drought Prevention and Control Headquarters issued the first yellow level flash flood warning of this year’s flooding season.</seg>

        <seg id="19">Jiangsu currently still has 29 rivers (lakes) on which a total of 44 water stations report water levels above warning and protection levels.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Recently, the Yangtze River and Huaihe River basins in China have experienced flooding, and a portion of the affected population has been moved to temporary resettlement sites.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Residential density at such resettlement sites is high, and the temporary increase in fire and electricity usage in turn increases fire hazards.</seg>
        <seg id="22">On July 25th, the Ministry of Emergency Management Firefighting and Rescue Bureau issued fire safety procedures for flood control resettlement sites, and also called on fire safety departments to take on the task of fire prevention, called on the public to strengthen their awareness of fire control, and called on all parties to work together to create a good environment for fire prevention.</seg>

        <seg id="4">Image courtesy of China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group</seg>
        <seg id="5">Chinanews.com, Chongqing, posted July 26th (correspondent Han Lu) On July 26th, this reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group LTD that the Zhengzhou–Wanzhou high-speed railway’s Small Three Gorges Tunnel, with a total length of roughly 18.9 km, had been completed the same day.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Based on available information, the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is both the longest high-speed rail tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, and also, among the rail projects under construction in China, is the longest dual-track single-hole high-speed rail tunnel with a 350 km/h design speed.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway links cities within the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Chongqing, connects to the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xuzhou-Lanzhou high-speed rail routes via the Zhengzhou North Station and reaches Chongqing through the Chongqing-Wanzhou intercity railway link via the Wanzhou South Station; it is an important component of China’s "Eight Vertical and Eight Horizontal" network that connects to the Yangtze River corridor and the Hohhot–Nanning corridor.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was fully connected on the 26th.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Image of fully opened tunnel.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway begins in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, then runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City in Hubei Province, and terminates in Wanzhou District, Chongqing City; the length of the new line is about 818 km, of which 184 km run through the borders of Chongqing, and has a design speed of 350 km/h.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The Zhengzhou-Xiangyang stage of the line opened early on December 1st, 2019, and construction on the Chongqing stage is being accelerated.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which was fully connected on the 26th, is a total-line control project for the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway; the project is located at the border of Fengjie County and Wushan County, Chongqing City, has a total length of roughly 18.9 km, and has a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Work began on the tunnel in February of 2017, and the tunnel was fully connected on July 26th, 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Wang Guojun, director of tunnel design for the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway at China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group Co., Ltd., stated that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel cuts through highly complicated terrain and geological conditions, and faces risks such as karsts, sudden mudslides, and massive soft rock deformation, making it a Class I high-risk tunnel, for which design and construction are exceedingly difficult.</seg>
        <seg id="15">“During construction, we used approaches such as geological surveys, geophysical techniques, and advanced drilling methods to make geological forecasts far in advance and create special design plans for over 30 types of caves. For example, we built a bridge within the tunnel that was 24 meters in length across a karst cave gap that was 10 meters wide and 55 meters deep to avoid tunnel settlement,” he said.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The building company, the China Railway Tunnel Group, constructed the tunnel using a combination of dredging and blocking, building horizontal tunnels, water blocking, enhanced structural tunnel support, and building outflow treatment plants, which together ensured the project could proceed on schedule while avoiding damage from polluted wastewater to the Three Gorges Scenic Area, and at the same time, overcame construction problems such as 7 kilometers of karst soft rock deformation and other bad geology, as well as a maximum daily water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters.</seg>
        <seg id="17">When the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is completed and fully operational, it will have critical importance as a rapid and convenient passenger channel that connects the regions of Southwest China, the Central Plains, North China, and Northeast China which improves both the quality and capacity of the Southwest China railway network’s northeast corridor, improves the regional transit network, speeds up the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promotes inter-regional coordinated development, and facilitates the implementation of the Western Region development strategy.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Civil rights groups and several US cities and counties have filed a lawsuit against the US federal government, claiming the Trump administration’s attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US Census are both unconstitutional and would unworkable.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The US Census decides the allocation of seats in the US House of Representatives.</seg>
        <seg id="4">American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) executive director Sarah Brannon told VOA, “This is unworkable. “</seg>
        <seg id="5">She continued, saying Trump’s demand that the US Census determine the immigration status of census respondents was difficult and “not very reliable”. “</seg>
        <seg id="6">Common Cause, another civil rights organization, filed a lawsuit on Thursday to challenge Trump’s executive order.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Several New Jersey and Georgia cities joined the lawsuit.</seg>
        <seg id="8">On Friday, Virginia’s Arlington County also joined the lawsuit.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Arlington County Board Chair Libby Garvey said, “The US Constitution requires that we make an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We need an accurate count of every resident in Arlington County, and we must never illegal attempts like these to frighten away and shrink our immigrant community succeed. “</seg>
        <seg id="10">Other individuals and organizations expressed praise for Trump’s executive order.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall called the executive order a “victory” for the state.</seg>
        <seg id="12">He said, “The allocation of House of Representatives and electoral college seats must be based on the number of residents in each state, particularly the number of legal residents. “</seg>
        <seg id="13">Last year, the US Supreme Court stopped the Trump administration’s attempts to include citizenship questions on the 2020 census form.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Earlier this week President Trump signed an executive order directing Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who oversees the US Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the census, so that the administration can exclude this population from state census results, which in turn are used to determine whether each state will increase, decrease, or maintain its number of seats in the House of Representatives.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Hunan in midsummer is steaming hot.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The enthusiasm unleased by the on-the-spot observation meeting for promoting the construction of industrial projects in the whole province surpassed even the heat summer heat, and the distinct guidance of "comparing strength with industry and defining heroes with projects" inspired industry in Hunan.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The development of Hunan should rely on constructing projects and fostering industries.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Faced with the unusual first half of the year, under the firm leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the whole province united as one and made every effort to fight the tough battles against COVID-19 pandemic prevention and flood control, and adopted industrial projects as the "pioneer" in the implementation of "ensuring stability in employment, financial operations, foreign trade, foreign investment, domestic investment, and expectations" and "ensuring security in job, basic living needs, operations of market entities, food and energy security, stable industrial and supply chains, and the normal functioning of primary-level governments".</seg>
        <seg id="6">From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in the first quarter to a year-on-year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is hard to imagine how many difficulties we have overcome and how much effort we have expended during this period.</seg>
        <seg id="7">In this precious report, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to speed up the recovery of the economy and stable development.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The trend is irreversible.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation, and not only should we be good at accumulating and seeking potential, but also we should be good at recognizing, seeking, and acting according to changes.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Under the complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to painstaking efforts to attract investment, we need to concentrate on researching the new characteristics of the current new situation, grasp the rules more scientifically and be more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development paradigm featuring dual circulation, in which domestic and overseas markets reinforce each other, with the domestic market as the mainstay.</seg>
        <seg id="11">We have paid more attention to improving the basic capabilities of industry.</seg>
        <seg id="12">In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries start and sow hopes in our province, but also enterprises in traditional industries have accelerated their deployment in digital, intelligent, and green industrial transformation.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Transformations have been made in the existing production line of the project of Yiyang Aoshikang No.3 Science Park, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit board has taken the lead; the new factory of the Changde Cigarette Factory of China Tobacco Hunan Industrial Corporation was committed to the process of intelligent transformation and the construction of modern factories, which was also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprouting new buds"; focusing on the national major strategy and "new infrastructure and new urbanization initiatives and major projects", we have focused on consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively cultivated and developed emerging industries, and comprehensively increased the strength of scientific and technological innovation and localization substitution to continuously consolidate basic conditions and accumulate transformation momentum.</seg>
        <seg id="14">We have paid more attention to cultivating and developing new industries, new business forms, and new models.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The unexpected COVID-19 outbreak brought about the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation; in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry of our province grew by 12.6%, and the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above a designated size increased by 32.2% over the same period last year, and the income of online meals from catering enterprises increased by 35.6% over the same period last year.</seg>
        <seg id="16">We have created new opportunities out of crises and opened up new prospects in changing circumstances; we have actively promoted digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guided the integrated development of the digital economy and real economy.</seg>
        <seg id="17">We have paid more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain and the supply chain.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Construction machinery is the main force of industry in Hunan, but two thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, so there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.</seg>
        <seg id="19">To strengthen industrial chain thinking and better grasp the project, we need to continuously accumulate experience from leading enterprises and achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain; we should also cultivate all localities with great concentration, stimulate the "chain" reaction by strengthening the chain, supplementing the chain, and extending the chain, promote the collaborative layout of relevant supporting industries, and speed up the construction of an independent, controllable, safe, and reliable industrial chain and supply chain.</seg>
        <seg id="20">We are overcoming hardship together and supporting our enterprises; Hunan is still a land of enthusiasm and happiness with a good business environment and emerging business opportunities.</seg>
        <seg id="21">All parts of the province have frequently employed new and practical methods, believing that the "burden reduction" of enterprises promotes the "acceleration" of high-quality development; "shareholder type" services have been implemented in Shaoyang to guarantee the high efficiency of enterprises; in the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, there were many vivid stories about finding weak links and pain points, and turning risks into opportunities.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Focusing on the research, cultivation, and development of industries, and solidly optimizing the business environment will surely win the favor of more investors.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Difficulties ahead remain, but the state of overcoming difficulties has become the normal state for the whole province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.</seg>
        <seg id="24">During this critical period, we must learn and carry out the important instructions and spirit of general secretary Xi Jinping, and respond to external uncertainties effectively with the certainty of our work; we must persevere in promoting industrial projects and uniting as one with enthusiasm to ensure that the "13th Five-Year Plan" and the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects will be accomplished successfully.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Overall Stable Employment and Price Indicate “Temperature” of Economy</seg>
        <seg id="4">Reported by Economic Daily·ce.cn correspondent Lin Huocan</seg>
        <seg id="5">Facing the impact of COVID-19 in the first half of this year, China carried forward pandemic prevention and control as well as economic and social development in a coordinated manner; pandemic prevention and control continues to improve, while the economy is obviously recovering, and with employment and commodity prices, which are closely related to people’s well-being, in a generally stable state, China’s economy is presenting an economic performance card with “normal temperature”.</seg>
        <seg id="6">In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate increased.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Especially in February, the production and operation of many companies were basically shutdown, and with demand for labor decreased and recruitment postponed or cancelled, the urban unemployment rate increased as a result.</seg>
        <seg id="8">As the outbreak prevention and control outcomes took a turn for the better, the order of production and living standards across the society is recovering.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The Party Central Committee adheres to the key idea of seeking improvements in stability to further enhance the hedging strength of macro policies, reinforce pro-employment policies in all dimensions, and to actively facilitate efforts in assisting companies to maintain staffing stability and expand employment.</seg>
        <seg id="10">China is reinforcing policies to offset the impact and maintain employment with a portfolio of “reduce, exempt, defer, return and subsidy” policies: reducing and exempting 3 types of social insurance for companies in a phased manner, allowing deferred payments of social insurance fees, increasing beneficiary ranges for returning unemployment insurance to medium, small, and micro enterprises to maintain work posts and for work-based training policies, and providing subsidies for companies employing key population groups.</seg>
        <seg id="11">As employment stabilization policies were implemented, companies demands for labor gradually recovered, and as employment improves, the urban unemployment rate has decreases; in June, the unemployment rate was 5.7%.</seg>
        <seg id="12">According to Zhang Yi, Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of National Bureau of Statistics, all employment policies continued to be effective in the second quarter; labor that retreated earlier due to the outbreak is returning gradually, and in June, the urban labor participation rate increased around 10 points compared to February, close to that of the same period last year.</seg>
        <seg id="13">As data shows, the total urban employment in June increased 19% compared to February, with many industries bouncing back to pre-pandemic levels; average weekly working hours of company employees reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February, and 0.1 hours higher than in January.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Commodity prices are also relevant for families.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In January, CPI increased 5.4% year on year, a record high in many years.</seg>
        <seg id="16">In February, year-on-year CPI dropped slighted, but was still above 5%.</seg>
        <seg id="17">High level year-on-year CPI growth was driven by consumer demand before Spring Festival, but even with Spring Festival demand, it fell by month and was lower on a year-on-year base.</seg>
        <seg id="18">However, COVID-19 had an obvious impact on commodity prices.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Affected by pandemic prevention and control, delays in logistics and supplies, increases in transportation costs occurred across the country in January and February; also, as some people rushed to hoard, the prices of some daily necessities went up.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In response to disturbances in commodity prices from pandemic prevention and control, the relevant authorities put major daily supplies in emergency circulation to ensure unblocked supply.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Through a series of policies and measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruit was secured.</seg>
        <seg id="22">In response to the sharp rise in pork price at the beginning of the year, the central government rolled out policies to maintain prices and supply, and regions and departments swiftly implemented them accordingly; as a result, the pork reserve supply obviously improved, capacity in pigs for slaughter was restored in an orderly manner, and order in production and sales gradually returned to normal.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Since March, pork prices have been dropping continuously, leading food prices to fall back to a 10.6% year-on-year increase in May; in June, affected by slowed output of pigs for slaughter, reduced imports, and recovered group consumption, pork prices saw slight month-on-month growth.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Seasonal changes in fresh vegetable prices were clear, with an average of 3.4% growth in the first half.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Due to a high year-on-year starting point last year, fresh fruit saw continuous drop in year-on-year prices, with an average 13.3% drop in the first half.</seg>
        <seg id="26">With people’s essential everyday needs effectively secured, the overall economic and social order was kept stable.</seg>
        <seg id="27">As transportation and logistics gradually returned to normal, regions reinforced supply guarantee measures, and market demand and supply took a turn for the better.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Since March, month-on-month CPI dropped for 4 consecutive months, year-on-year growth fell back to 2.5% in June from 4.3% in March, and overall commodity prices have stabilized.</seg>
        <seg id="29">In the next half of the year, commodity prices in the country will continue to maintain at a moderate level, with no significant inflation pressure overall, however, we still need to facilitate restoring the order of production and living with the premise of regular outbreak prevention and control.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Natural disasters like flood and drought in major agricultural production regions of crops, vegetables, and fruit must be dealt with efficiently, market supervision and regulation must be reinforced to sternly crack down regrading and price-gouging behaviors that disturb market order.</seg>

        <seg id="3">However, according to a report from Reuters, Harry and Meghan have disassociated themselves from the book, claiming that they refused to be interviewed by the author and did not provide any content for it.</seg>

        <seg id="7">冰山的形成是 当它们从冰川断裂开 或者从冰架上断裂开。</seg>
        <seg id="8">每个冰山都有它们自己的独特个性。</seg>
        <seg id="9">它们 与其周边的环境 和其情况的互动具有一个鲜明的方式。</seg>
        <seg id="10">有些冰山拒绝妥协 坚持到底， 而另一些冰山就不能忍受 在一时剧烈激情喷涌下就水崩冰裂。</seg>
        <seg id="11">当你看到冰山，很容易就想到 它们都是孤立的， 它们是独立的，单独一体的， 更像是我们人类有时候对自身的看法。</seg>
        <seg id="12">但现实远不止这个。</seg>
        <seg id="13">随着冰山融化， 我呼吸到 它古老的气味。</seg>
        <seg id="14">随着冰山融化， 它释放了富有矿物质的鲜水 它们滋养了万物。</seg>
        <seg id="15">我着手拍摄这些冰山 好似我在拍摄我祖先的肖像， 了解到在这些个别的时刻 冰山原是以那样方式存在 但再也不会像那样存在了。</seg>
        <seg id="16">当它们融化时，这绝不是死亡； 也绝不是一个终结， 而是 通往生生不息之路的一个延续。</seg>
        <seg id="17">我拍摄过的冰山，有些冰是非常年轻-- 几千年年龄。</seg>
        <seg id="18">有些冰 超过十万年。</seg>
        <seg id="19">我想给大家展示的最后图片 是我在格陵兰岛的 Kekertsuatsiak上拍摄的一个冰山。</seg>
        <seg id="20">这是一个非常难得的机会 大家实际上得以见证 一个冰山翻滚。</seg>
        <seg id="21">所以这就如图所示。</seg>
        <seg id="22">在左边你能看到一个小船。</seg>
        <seg id="23">这是一个约15英尺的船。</seg>
        <seg id="24">我想让你注意 冰山的形状 它在水面上的变形。</seg>
        <seg id="25">在这儿你看到它开始翻滚， 小船移动到另一边，一个男人站在那里。</seg>
        <seg id="26">这是一个平均尺寸的格陵兰冰山。</seg>
        <seg id="27">它浮出水面大约有120英尺高 或者40米高。</seg>
        <seg id="28">这视频是实时拍摄的。</seg>
        <seg id="29">（音乐） 就像这冰山， 它们展示给大家的是其个性的不同方面。</seg>

        <seg id="1">As an artist, connection is very important to me.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.</seg>
        <seg id="3">I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I was in awe.</seg>
        <seg id="5">My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Each iceberg has its own individual personality.</seg>
        <seg id="9">They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.</seg>
        <seg id="11">It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.</seg>
        <seg id="12">But the reality is far from it.</seg>
        <seg id="13">As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.</seg>
        <seg id="14">As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life.</seg>
        <seg id="15">I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.</seg>
        <seg id="16">It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old.</seg>
        <seg id="18">And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.</seg>
        <seg id="20">It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling.</seg>
        <seg id="21">So here it is.</seg>
        <seg id="22">You can see on the left side a small boat.</seg>
        <seg id="23">That's about a 15-foot boat.</seg>
        <seg id="24">And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.</seg>
        <seg id="25">You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.</seg>
        <seg id="26">This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.</seg>
        <seg id="28">And this video is real time.</seg>
        <seg id="29">(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Thank you.</seg>
        <seg id="31">(Applause)</seg>

        <seg id="5">中新网青海海南7月26日电 题：青海湖畔“花海直播间”：“甜蜜”带货助农增收</seg>
        <seg id="6">作者 胡贵龙 潘雨洁</seg>
        <seg id="7">“盛夏青海湖畔，满眼金花、万蜂飞舞，这里海拔较高、昼夜温差大、空气污染少，强烈的光照孕育了最顽强、慷慨的蜂群，造就了青海蜂王浆高活性、高蛋白、富含营养价值、低糖低脂的特点。”</seg>
        <seg id="8">26日，青海省海南藏族自治州工业和信息管理局副局长张建勋表示。</seg>
        <seg id="9">当日，“同心战疫春浆助农”蜂产品直播带货活动在青海湖畔举行，中国蜂产品协会及企业家代表、蜂农等多方齐聚共同推介青海特色蜂产品，线上线下共计销售近一万瓶青海高原蜂王浆，带货总额近380万元。</seg>
        <seg id="10">图为蜂农现场展示蜂产品。</seg>
        <seg id="11">据悉，此次直播带货活动借助北京厚德礼蜂业连锁店网络、快手、淘宝等国内知名蜂产品零售企业、直播、电商平台，促成“企业+蜂农+种植户”的交流合作，并通过线上、线下渠道持续向消费者发放“青海高原春浆消费券”， 预计企业全年让利总额近528万元。</seg>
        <seg id="12">对此，北京厚德礼蜂业股份有限公司总裁邬娜认为“很值得”：“此举能够扩大青海蜂产品的知名度，吸引更多消费者了解、喜欢无添加纯天然的蜂产品，带动蜂农增收。”</seg>
        <seg id="13">目前，该公司已与青海云蜜蜂业有限公司、青海花宝蜂业股份合作公司签订生产合作战略协议，冀共同推动青海当地蜂产业长足发展。</seg>
        <seg id="14">图为青海湖畔油菜花海。</seg>
        <seg id="15">今春，各地因疫情防控需要设置道路通行关卡，蜂农们“追花逐蜜”的路途受阻，许多蜜蜂因错过花期、缺少食物而死亡，蜂农收入受到严重影响。</seg>
        <seg id="16">“一年到头，蜂农们跟随花期长途跋涉，从云南、四川一路向北迁往西北地区，他们风餐露宿、居无定所，十分辛苦。</seg>
        <seg id="17">作为企业，我们有责任帮助他们。”</seg>
        <seg id="18">邬娜称。</seg>
        <seg id="19">“小蜜蜂是‘环境侦察兵’，污染严重的地区蜜蜂也无法生存。”中国蜂产品协会常务副会长赵小川介绍，蜜蜂授粉是生态链的重要环节，对于保护植物的多样性和改善生态环境有着不可替代的作用。</seg>
        <seg id="20">同时，蜜蜂授粉能使农作物增产提质，特别在广种而管理条件差的地区，授粉的意义更大。</seg>
        <seg id="21">研究数据显示，授粉能够使油菜增产15% - 30%左右。</seg>
        <seg id="22">图为中国蜂产品协会常务副会长赵小川(右)推介青海蜂产品。</seg>
        <seg id="23">“蜜蜂授粉创造的经济、生态和社会效益远大于蜂产品本身的价值，蜂产业在人类健康、农作物生产、植被繁衍、生态保护方面潜力巨大，而人们一直对此知之甚少。”</seg>
        <seg id="24">赵小川表示。</seg>
        <seg id="25">而如今，养蜂人数越来越少，除了常年奔波在外的蜂农，尚有许多行动不便的贫困户选择以蜂箱入股合作社。</seg>
        <seg id="26">“国家有资金支持，我们联系技术人员帮助指导，蜂农对市场环境缺乏了解与判断，要打开销路也需政府、企业、产业协会的帮助与协调。”</seg>
        <seg id="27">赵小川说。</seg>
        <seg id="28">“希望大家在未来更多关注、帮扶养蜂群体，”邬娜表示，“我们的蜂产品也严格按照国家标准进行筛选和管控，保证品质，在帮助蜂农的同时保护消费者权益。”</seg>

        <seg id="5">chinanews.com, South Qinghai Lake, reported July 26th, headline: Qinghai Lake “Sea of Flowers Livecast Studio”: “Sweetness“ increases farmer income</seg>
        <seg id="6">Writers: Hu Guilong, Pan Yujie</seg>
        <seg id="7">“At Qinghai Lake in midsummer, there are golden flowers as far as the eye can see, and innumerable bees flying everywhere; the high elevation is high, large temperature difference between night and day, low air pollution, and strong illumination breeds the most resilient and fertile bee colonies which create the highly active, protein-rich, and nutritious Qinghai royal jelly, which is also low in sugar and fat, “</seg>
        <seg id="8">said Zhang Jianxun, assistant director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The same day, the “Fighting the Epidemic Together Spring Royal Jelly Farmer Assistance” livecast sales event was held at Qinghai Lake, at which company representatives from the Chinese Bee Products Association, beekeepers, and many others came together to promote Qinghai’s bee products, selling nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly for a value of almost 3.8 million yuan.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Image: Beekeepers at the event displaying their products.</seg>
        <seg id="11">According to reports, this livecast sales event helped the Beijing Houdeli Bee Products, Kuaishou, Taobao, and other well-known chain store networks, live broadcast platforms, and e-commerce platforms promote “enterprise + apiary + grower” exchange and cooperation, connect online and offline channels, and continue to issue “Qinghai Plateau Spring Jelly Consumption Vouchers” to consumers, helping these customers earn an estimated total annual profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Wu Na, CEO of Beijing Houdeli Bee Products, said the event was “very worthwhile”: “This event helps grow the popularity of Qinghai bee products, helps more consumers to learn about and appreciate pure, natural bee products without additives, and drives beekeeper income growth.” “</seg>
        <seg id="13">Currently, the company has signed strategic production cooperation agreements with Qinghai Cloud Honey LTD and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Holdings LTD, and they will work together to promote the rapid development of Qinghai’s bee products industry.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Image: Rape blossoms beside Qinghai Lake.</seg>
        <seg id="15">This spring, due to roadblocks set up to control the epidemic, beekeepers have been blocked from their usual “following the flowers to produce honey” routes, many bees have died of starvation because they missed the flowering periods, and beekeeper incomes have suffered a sharp decline.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Throughout the year, beekeepers typically travel long distances to follow the flowering periods, from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way to the northwest, they are exposed to the weather and have no fixed residence, and it’s very difficult work.</seg>
        <seg id="17">We have a responsibility as entrepreneurs to help them, “</seg>
        <seg id="18">said Wu Na.</seg>
        <seg id="19">“Bees are ‘nature’s advance scouts’, because they can’t survive in heavily polluted areas. “ Zhao Xiaochuan, deputy secretary of the China Bee Products Association, explained that pollination by bees is a very important link in the ecological chain, and that it plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the environment.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Bee pollination also increases the yield and quality of crops, and is even more important in regions with a wide diversity of crops and poor farm management.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Research data proves that pollination improves rapeseed yields by 15-30%.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Image: Zhao Xiaochuan (right), deputy secretary of the China Bee Products Association, introducing Qinghai bee products.</seg>
        <seg id="23">“The economic, environmental, and social benefits of bee pollination go far beyond the mere value of the bee products, and the apiary industry has enormous potential in the areas of human health, plant reproduction, and environmental protection, but there has never been wide awareness of this fact, “</seg>
        <seg id="24">said Zhao Xiaochuan.</seg>
        <seg id="25">The number of beekeepers is declining, but in addition to the traveling industry professionals, there are also many poor households with limited mobility who practice beekeepers as part of cooperatives.</seg>
        <seg id="26">“The country offers financial support, and we’ve contacted technology experts for help and guidance, but beekeepers lack understanding and discernment of the market environment, so opening new markets requires help and coordination from government, enterprises, and industry associations, “</seg>
        <seg id="27">said Zhao Xiaochuan.</seg>
        <seg id="28">“I hope people will pay more attention to beekeepers and offer them support in the future,” said Wu Na. “And as we strive to help beekeepers, we strictly adhere to national standards in the selection and control of our bee products to ensure quality and protect the rights of consumers.” “</seg>

        <seg id="2">经济观察网 记者 饶贤君 7月26日，绿地控股（600606.SH）发布《关于国有股东拟通过公开征集受让方的方式协议转让公司部分股份暨复牌的提示性公告》。</seg>
        <seg id="3">公告内容显示，为进一步深化国资国企改革，优化国资布局结构调整，完善绿地股权结构，上海地产（集团）有限公司（以下简称“上海地产”）及上海城投（集团）有限公司（以下简称“上海城投” ）拟通过公开征集受让方的方式协议转让所持有的公司部分股份，拟转让的股份比例合计不超过绿地总股本的17.5% 。</seg>
        <seg id="4">本次拟转让股份的价格不低于下列两者之中的较高者：提示性公告日（2020 年7月27日）前30个交易日的每日加权平均价格的算术平均值；最近一个会计年度公司经审计的每股净资产值。</seg>
        <seg id="5">目前，对绿地的新战略投资者仍无定论，按照公告公示信息估算，新战略投资者要拿下绿地此次混改中转让的17.5%股权需要支付约140亿元的资金。</seg>
        <seg id="6">值得注意的是，本次股份转让完成后，预计绿地仍无控股股东及实际控制人，但控制权结构可能发生较大变化。</seg>
        <seg id="7">绿地控股自创立以来进行了多次体制机制改革：1992年-1997年，在纯国有体制下按照市场化规则运行；1997年-2013年，建立并不断完善国有控股、职工持股的股份制；2013年-2015年，引进战略投资者，形成国有及非公有资本交叉持股、相互融合的混合所有制；2015年至今，整体上市，成为公众公司。</seg>
        <seg id="8">绿地目前的混改方案与格力相似，2019年12月，高瓴资本领衔珠海明骏以416.62亿元接手格力电器（000651.SZ）15%股权，格力集团退居小股东，完成混改后，格力电器实施了高管激励计划、无实控人结构等现代化的企业管理方式。</seg>
        <seg id="9">上海地产、上海城投均为上海市国资委全资持有的国资企业集团，绿地控股董事长、总裁张玉良表示，绿地此举是上海按照党中央要求，推进国资国企综合性改革、加速新一阶段国资国企改革的重要举措，充分显示了因地制宜、量体裁衣的改革新思路，通过给上市公司引入新的优秀战略股东，支持企业进一步提高市场化程度，提升经营管理自由度，加速改革活力全面释放。</seg>

        <seg id="2">Eeo.com.cn reporter Rao Xianjun, July 26, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) issued a "Suggestive Announcement on the State-owned Shareholders' Intention to Transfer Part of the Company's Shares and Resume Trading through Public Solicitation of the Transferee."</seg>
        <seg id="3">According to the announcement, in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of state-owned assets, and improve the ownership structure of Greenland, Shanghai Land (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Land") and Shanghai Chengtou Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Chengtou Investment") plan to transfer part of the shares of the company held by the transferee through public solicitation, and the total proportion of the shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of Greenland.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The price of the shares to be transferred this time shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the 30 trading days before the suggestive announcement date (July 27, 2020); the audited net asset value per share of the company in the latest accounting year.</seg>
        <seg id="5">At present, there is still no final conclusion on the new strategic investors of Greenland, but according to the information estimates in the announcement, the new strategic investors need to pay about RMB 14 billion to take the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed-use reform of Greenland.</seg>
        <seg id="6">It is worth noting that after the completion of the share transfer, Greenland is expected to have no controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but the control structure may change greatly.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Since its establishment, Greenland Holdings has carried out many institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it was operated under the pure state-owned system in accordance with market-oriented rules; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the joint-stock system of state-owned holding and employee shareholding; from 2013 to 2015, strategic investors were introduced to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; and since 2015, the company has been entirely listed and has become a public company.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Greenland's current mixed reform plan is similar to Gree's: in December 2019, Zhuhai Mingjun, led by Hillhouse Capital, took over 15% of the shares of Gree Electric Appliances (000651.SZ) with RMB 41.662 billion, and the Gree Group retreated to being the minority shareholder; after the completion of the mixed reform, Gree implemented modern enterprise management methods, such as executive incentive plans and no real controller structure.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Shanghai Land and Shanghai Chengtou Investment are all state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by Shanghai SASAC, and Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland holdings, said that Greenland's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned assets and enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned assets and enterprises in the new era in accordance with the requirements of the CPC Central Committee; it also fully shows the new concept of reform that adapts measures to local conditions and acts according to actual circumstances, because it is necessary to introduce new shareholders to support the reform of corporate strategy, further improve the degree of corporate management freedom, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, reported July 25th (Correspondent: Li Ping) On July 25th, over 200 tourists from Shanghai on the D771 train arrived in Lanxi, Zhejiang Province, making this the first group tour to take an inter-provincial train since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed inter-province (region, city) group tours on July 14th.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Located in central and western Jiangxi, Lanxi City boasts beautiful scenery and many scenic spots such as Zhuge Bagua Village, the Dixia Changhe Scenic Area, and Zhiyan Village, all of which are to be visited by the more than 200 tourists in the tour group on their 2-day 1-night trip.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Li Li, assistant general manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) LTD, said that based on the latest policies, the company closely monitors demand for inter-province travel, communicates closely with Lanxi, and launched the “Shanghai to Lanxi” and “Summer Lotus-Viewing Two-Day Tour” products, the latter of which sold out less than a week after launching.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Mrs. Sun, from Shanghai, said she hadn’t left her house this year because of the pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="6">“I’ve been bored sitting at home for a long time, so when I saw a group tour, I shared the news with my friends right away, and we all signed up, and I’ve never visited Lanxi, so I’ve been looking forward to this trip, “ said Mrs. Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Sources state that in September of last year, Lanxi and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) LTD signed the “Ride the High-Speed Rail to Lanxi” strategic cooperation agreement, which aims to operate 12 dedicated high-speed tourism trains from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Anhui to Lanxi within the year.</seg>

        <seg id="5">数月来，美国总统特朗普反复要求全国各州复工复学，直至近日才改变态度，主动在公开场合佩戴口罩，而他的顾问更是“反咬一口”称一些州政府复工过早。</seg>
        <seg id="6">22日，白宫总统顾问凯莉安·康威在新闻发布会上表示，一些州政府没有遵守复工标准，过早重启了酒吧之类的场所。</seg>

        <seg id="4">As of July 23 local time, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States topped 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.</seg>
        <seg id="5">For months, U.S. President Trump has repeatedly asked for states to reopen businesses and schools, and only recently changed his attitude and started wearing masks in public, while his advisers accuse some state governments of reopening businesses too early.</seg>
        <seg id="6">On 22nd, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some states didn’t follow reopening standards and opened businesses like bars too early.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Conway also mentioned that statements regarding the President having “absolute power” in deciding states reopening matters are misinformed rumors.</seg>
        <seg id="8">“The President is a federalist who believes in the autonomous rights of states. "</seg>
        <seg id="9">she said in Trump’s defense.</seg>
        <seg id="10">However, this so-called “rumor” was stated by Trump himself at the White House outbreak briefing on April 13.</seg>
        <seg id="11">This flip-flop was mocked on the internet as “rewriting history”.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Attempting to rewrite history makes Kellyanne Conway a liar.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Trump called Gretchen Whitmer, governor of Michigan, a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on lockdown.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Trump wanted to facilitate reopening so that he could hold rallies.</seg>
        <seg id="15">This isn’t the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.</seg>
        <seg id="16">On April 15, when interviewed by Fox News, Conway blurted out, “This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, folks! "</seg>
        <seg id="17">She seemed to have taken “19” as a version number and was laughed at on the internet, “Read a newspaper if you have no common sense!”</seg>

        <seg id="11">计算机技术越发达， 我们用来保护数据的 手段就越脆弱。</seg>
        <seg id="12">尤其是一种新的计算机技术， 叫做量子计算机， 它利用自然界的微观粒子 来大幅增加计算机的运算能力。</seg>
        <seg id="13">它的运算能力强大到 可以破解我们今天所用的 许多加密系统。</seg>
        <seg id="14">那么我们是不是毫无希望了呢？</seg>
        <seg id="15">我们是不是该开始 收拾电子生存装备 来迎接即将到来的数据末日呢？</seg>
        <seg id="16">我认为，还没到那一步。</seg>

        <seg id="18">更重要的是， 加密领域已经出现了许多重大突破。</seg>

        <seg id="24">我们打算用量子来对抗量子。</seg>
        <seg id="25">怎么来实现呢？</seg>
        <seg id="26">首先，我们来快速了解 一下加密的世界。</seg>
        <seg id="27">你需要一个公文包， 你有一些重要的文件 要送给你的好朋友，詹姆斯·邦德， 要锁起来，保证安全。</seg>
        <seg id="28">因为这些材料是最高机密， 我们要用一个超级先进的公文包。</seg>
        <seg id="29">它配有一把特殊的密码锁， 一旦锁上， 就会把文件的内容 转换为随机的数字。</seg>
        <seg id="30">因此你只要把文件放进去，锁上， 这个时候文件已经转换为 随机的数字了， 你把这个公文包送给詹姆斯。</seg>
        <seg id="31">公文包还没送到的时候， 你打电话告诉他密码。</seg>
        <seg id="32">一旦他拿到公文包，输入密码， 文件破译完成，简直完美， 你成功地把一份加密信息 传递给了詹姆斯·邦德。</seg>
        <seg id="33">（笑声） 一个好玩的例子，但是它 说明了加密的3个重点。</seg>
        <seg id="34">密码——我们称之为加密钥匙。</seg>
        <seg id="35">你可以把它想像成密码。</seg>
        <seg id="36">告诉詹姆斯密码的那通电话。</seg>
        <seg id="37">我们称之为秘钥传递。</seg>
        <seg id="38">这保证我们 能将秘钥安全的送到指定地点。</seg>
        <seg id="39">以及用来加密和解密文件的锁。</seg>
        <seg id="40">我们称之为加密算法。</seg>
        <seg id="41">通过秘钥，它将文件中的内容 转换为随机的数字。</seg>
        <seg id="42">一个好的算法能够做到这一点， 没有秘钥的话很难将密码破解。</seg>
        <seg id="43">算法的重要性就在于 如果有人得到了公文包，把它打开， 没有秘钥，不知道加密算法， 就无法读取文档里的内容。</seg>
        <seg id="44">得到的只是一些随机的数字。</seg>
        <seg id="45">大部分的安全系统 都依赖于安全的秘钥传递方式， 将秘钥传递到正确的地方。</seg>
        <seg id="46">然而，迅速增长的计算能力 危及到了我们目前所使用的 许多秘钥传递方式。</seg>
        <seg id="47">举一个例子，我们现在 应用非常广泛的系统——RSA。</seg>
        <seg id="48">它在1977年被发明出来的时候， 要花大约4千万亿年， 才能破解一个426位的RSA秘钥。</seg>
        <seg id="49">而到了1994年， 仅仅才过了17年， 这个密码就被破解了。</seg>
        <seg id="50">随着计算机性能越来越强， 我们需要的密码也越来越长。</seg>
        <seg id="51">现在我们经常会使用 2048或者4096位的密码。</seg>
        <seg id="52">如您所见，加密者和解密者 之间的战斗正在进行， 都想战胜对方。</seg>
        <seg id="53">今后10到15年， 量子计算机的到来， 将会更快地破解复杂的数学算法， 这些算法是今天 我们使用的加密系统的基础。</seg>
        <seg id="54">事实上，量子计算机 将把我们的安全城堡 变成一触即倒的纸牌屋。</seg>
        <seg id="55">我们要设法保护我们的城堡。</seg>
        <seg id="56">近几年出现了许多研究机构， 研究如何用量子效应来增强加密。</seg>
        <seg id="57">人们已经取得了一些 令人兴奋的突破。</seg>
        <seg id="58">还记得加密的3个重点吗？ 高质量的秘钥，安全的秘钥传递 和很强的算法。</seg>
        <seg id="59">然而，科学和工程学的进步， 已经危及到了其中2个重点。</seg>
        <seg id="60">首当其冲的就是秘钥。</seg>
        <seg id="61">随机数字是构成秘钥的基础。</seg>
        <seg id="62">但到了今天， 它们不再是真正随机了。</seg>
        <seg id="63">目前，我们生成秘钥， 是根据随机数字频率， 靠软件生成的， 我们称之为伪随机数字。</seg>
        <seg id="64">程序或者数学方法生成的数字， 总会有一些，也许并不 那么明显的规律在里面。</seg>
        <seg id="65">这些数字的随机性越低， 或者用术语来讲， 包含的墒越低， 它们就越容易被预测到。</seg>
        <seg id="66">最近，有些赌场就被攻击了， 攻击的方式很有创意。</seg>
        <seg id="67">他们对准老虎机拍摄一段时间， 然后进行分析。</seg>
        <seg id="68">网络罪犯们 利用逆向工程，制造出转盘背后的 伪随机数字生成器。</seg>
        <seg id="69">这样一来他们就有很大几率 预测到转盘的转动， 从而赚到大笔金钱。</seg>
        <seg id="70">秘钥也同样不安全。</seg>
        <seg id="71">拥有一个真正的随机数字生成器 对于生成安全的密码而言很重要。</seg>
        <seg id="72">数年来，研究者们一直在努力制造 真正的随机数字生成器。</seg>
        <seg id="73">但大部分的设计，要么不够随机， 要么不够快，要么很难重复使用。</seg>
        <seg id="74">但是量子的世界是真正随机的。</seg>
        <seg id="75">利用这种真正的随机性非常重要。</seg>
        <seg id="76">能够测量量子效应的装置 可以非常快速地生成 连续不断的随机数字流。</seg>
        <seg id="77">刚刚说的赌场犯罪再无上演可能。</seg>
        <seg id="78">来自世界各地的数所大学和公司 在集中精力制造 真正的随机数字生成器。</seg>
        <seg id="79">在我的公司，我们的 量子随机数字生成器 诞生于一张2米长1米宽的光学桌。</seg>
        <seg id="80">之后我们把它缩小到一个盒子大小。</seg>
        <seg id="81">到今天，已经可以把它装到一张PCI卡上， 插到一台普通的计算机上。</seg>
        <seg id="82">这是世界上速度最快的， 真正随机的数字生成器。</seg>
        <seg id="83">它通过测量量子效应， 每秒可以生成10亿个随机数字。</seg>
        <seg id="84">今天已经被广泛用于世界各地， 来提升云服务提供商、 银行和政府机构的 安全性。</seg>
        <seg id="85">（掌声） 但是，即便有了真正的 随机数字生成器， 我们还面临 第2个大的网络安全威胁： 那就是秘钥的安全传递问题。</seg>
        <seg id="86">目前的秘钥传输技术 无法对抗量子计算机。</seg>
        <seg id="87">而针对这一问题的量子解决方案， 叫做量子秘钥分发，简称QKD， 它利用了量子力学一个基础的 违反直觉的特性。</seg>
        <seg id="88">观察微观粒子这个行为， 会改变这个粒子。</seg>
        <seg id="89">我举个例子来说明。</seg>
        <seg id="90">我们再来回想一下， 要把密码交给詹姆斯·邦德。</seg>
        <seg id="91">不过这一次，我们不给他打电话， 我们利用量子效应， 用一束激光携带这个密码， 通过普通的光纤传递给詹姆斯。</seg>
        <seg id="92">我们假设诺博士想拿到这个密码。</seg>
        <seg id="93">幸运的是，诺博士在尝试拦截 这个量子秘钥的过程中 会留下电子指纹， 詹姆斯和你都能察觉到。</seg>
        <seg id="94">这样被拦截的秘钥就会作废。</seg>
        <seg id="95">而留下来的秘钥 能够为数据提供强大的保护。</seg>
        <seg id="96">因为这种安全机制 是以物理学基本原理为基础， 量子计算机，或者未来的 任何超级计算机， 都不可能破解它。</seg>
        <seg id="97">我和我的团队正在跟许多顶尖大学 以及国防部门一起合作， 改进这项激动人心的技术， 发展下一代安全产品。</seg>
        <seg id="98">物联网预示了一个 高度互联时代的来临， 预计到2020年将会有 250-300亿设备接入互联网。</seg>
        <seg id="99">要想我们的社会 在物联网世界正常运作， 那么对这些互联设备系统的 信任就至关重要。</seg>
        <seg id="100">我们相信量子技术 对于建立这种信任会非常重要， 它将保证我们充分享受 这些神奇的创新， 享受这些能让我们的生活 丰富多彩的创新。</seg>

        <seg id="1">Recently, we've seen the effects of cyber attacks on the business world.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Data breaches at companies like JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target have caused losses of hundreds of millions and in some cases, billions of dollars.</seg>
        <seg id="3">It wouldn't take many large attacks to ravage the world economy.</seg>
        <seg id="4">And the public sector has not been immune, either.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Security clearance and fingerprint data was compromised, affecting 22 million employees.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And you may have heard of the attempt by state-sponsored hackers to use stolen data to influence election outcomes in a number of countries.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Two recent examples are the compromise of a large amount of data from the Bundestag, the national Parliament of Germany, and the theft of emails from the US Democratic National Committee.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The cyber threat is now affecting our democratic processes.</seg>
        <seg id="10">And it's likely to get worse.</seg>
        <seg id="11">As computer technology is becoming more powerful, the systems we use to protect our data are becoming more vulnerable.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Adding to the concern is a new type of computing technology, called quantum computing, which leverages microscopic properties of nature to deliver unimaginable increases in computational power.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It's so powerful that it will crack many of the encryption systems that we use today.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So is the situation hopeless?</seg>
        <seg id="15">Should we start packing our digital survival gear and prepare for an upcoming data apocalypse?</seg>
        <seg id="16">I would say, not yet.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Quantum computing is still in the labs, and it will take a few years until it's put to practical applications.</seg>
        <seg id="18">More important, there have been major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="19">For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.</seg>
        <seg id="20">About 15 years ago, when I learned of our new-found ability to create quantum effects that don't exist in nature, I was excited.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to make encryption stronger really intrigued me.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Today, a select groups of companies and labs around the world, including mine, are maturing this technology for practical applications.</seg>
        <seg id="23">That's right.</seg>
        <seg id="24">We are now preparing to fight quantum with quantum.</seg>
        <seg id="25">So how does this all work?</seg>
        <seg id="26">Well, first, let's take a quick tour of the world of encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="27">For that, you'll need a briefcase, some important documents that you want to send your friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep it all safe.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Because the documents are top secret, we're going to use an advanced briefcase.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It has a special combination lock which, when closed, converts all the text in the documents to random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="30">So you put your documents inside, close the lock -- at which point in time the documents get converted to random numbers -- and you send the briefcase to James.</seg>
        <seg id="31">While it's on its way, you call him to give him the code.</seg>
        <seg id="32">When he gets the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents get unscrambled, and voilà, you've just sent an encoded message to James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="33">(Laughter) A fun example, but it does illustrate three things important for encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="34">The code -- we call this an encryption key.</seg>
        <seg id="35">You can think of it as a password.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The call to James to give him the code for the combination lock.</seg>
        <seg id="37">We call this key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="38">This is how you ensure you get the encryption key securely to the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">And the lock, which encodes and decodes the document.</seg>
        <seg id="40">We call this an encryption algorithm.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Using the key, it encodes the text in the documents to random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="42">A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without the key it's very difficult to unscramble.</seg>
        <seg id="43">What makes encryption so important is that if someone were to capture the briefcase and cut it open without the encryption key and the encryption algorithm, they wouldn't be able to read the documents.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They would look like nothing more than a bunch of random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Most security systems rely on a secure method for key exchange to communicate the encryption key to the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="46">However, rapid increases in computational power are putting at risk a number of the key exchange methods we have today.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Consider one of the very widely used systems today -- RSA.</seg>
        <seg id="48">When it was invented, in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to break a 426-bit RSA key.</seg>
        <seg id="49">In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was broken.</seg>
        <seg id="50">As computers have become more and more powerful, we've had to use larger and larger codes.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Today we routinely use 2048 or 4096 bits.</seg>
        <seg id="52">As you can see, code makers and breakers are engaged in an ongoing battle to outwit each other.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10 to 15 years, they will even more rapidly crack the complex mathematics that underlies many of our encryption systems today.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Indeed, the quantum computer is likely to turn our present security castle into a mere house of cards.</seg>
        <seg id="55">We have to find a way to defend our castle.</seg>
        <seg id="56">There's been a growing body of research in recent years looking at using quantum effects to make encryption stronger.</seg>
        <seg id="57">And there have been some exciting breakthroughs.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Remember those three things important for encryption -- high-quality keys, secure key exchange and a strong algorithm?</seg>
        <seg id="59">Well, advances in science and engineering are putting two of those three elements at risk.</seg>
        <seg id="60">First of all, those keys.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Random numbers are the foundational building blocks of encryption keys.</seg>
        <seg id="62">But today, they're not truly random.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Currently, we construct encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Numbers generated by a program or a mathematical recipe will have some, perhaps subtle, pattern to them.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The less random the numbers are, or in scientific terms, the less entropy they contain, the easier they are to predict.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Recently, several casinos have been victims of a creative attack.</seg>
        <seg id="67">The output of slot machines was recorded over a period of time and then analyzed.</seg>
        <seg id="68">This allowed the cyber criminals to reverse engineer the pseudo-random number generator behind the spinning wheels.</seg>
        <seg id="69">And allowed them, with high accuracy, to predict the spins of the wheels, enabling them to make big financial gains.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Similar risks apply to encryption keys.</seg>
        <seg id="71">So having a true random number generator is essential for secure encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="72">For years, researchers have been looking at building true random number generators.</seg>
        <seg id="73">But most designs to date are either not random enough, fast enough or aren't easily repeatable.</seg>
        <seg id="74">But the quantum world is truly random.</seg>
        <seg id="75">So it makes sense to take advantage of this intrinsic randomness.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Devices that can measure quantum effects can produce an endless stream of random numbers at high speed.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Foiling all those would-be casino criminals.</seg>
        <seg id="78">A select group of universities and companies around the world are focused on building true random number generators.</seg>
        <seg id="79">At my company, our quantum random number generator started life on a two meter by one meter optic table.</seg>
        <seg id="80">We were then able to reduce it to a server-size box.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Today, it's miniaturized into a PCI card that plugs into a standard computer.</seg>
        <seg id="82">This is the world's fastest true random number generator.</seg>
        <seg id="83">It measures quantum effects to produce a billion random numbers per second.</seg>
        <seg id="84">And it's in use today to improve security at cloud providers, banks and government agencies around the world.</seg>
        <seg id="85">(Applause) But even with a true random number generator, we've still got the second big cyber threat: the problem of secure key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="86">Current key exchange techniques will not stand up to a quantum computer.</seg>
        <seg id="87">The quantum solution to this problem is called quantum key distribution or QKD, which leverages a fundamental, counterintuitive characteristic of quantum mechanics.</seg>
        <seg id="88">The very act of looking at a quantum particle changes it.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Let me give you an example of how this works.</seg>
        <seg id="90">Consider again exchanging the code for the lock with James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="91">Except this time, instead of a call to give James the code, we're going to use quantum effects on a laser to carry the code and send it over standard optic fiber to James.</seg>
        <seg id="92">We assume that Dr. No is trying to hack the exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Luckily, Dr. No's attempt to intercept the quantum keys while in transit will leave fingerprints that James and you can detect.</seg>
        <seg id="94">This allows those intercepted keys to be discarded.</seg>
        <seg id="95">The keys which are then retained can be used to provide very strong data protection.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And because the security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer, or indeed any future supercomputer will not be able to break it.</seg>
        <seg id="97">My team and I are collaborating with leading universities and the defense sector to mature this exciting technology into the next generation of security products.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The internet of things is heralding a hyperconnected era with 25 to 30 billion connected devices forecast by 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="99">For the correct functioning of our society in an IoT world, trust in the systems that support these connected devices is vital.</seg>
        <seg id="100">We're betting that quantum technologies will be essential in providing this trust, enabling us to fully benefit from the amazing innovations that are going to so enrich our lives.</seg>
        <seg id="101">Thank you.</seg>
        <seg id="102">(Applause)</seg>

        <seg id="3">操场被砸，孩童获赔后再诉校方</seg>
        <seg id="4">□ 本报通讯员 赵一凡</seg>
        <seg id="5">3岁的小文在某大学操场玩耍时，意外被垒球队的陈某在投球时砸中了头部。</seg>
        <seg id="6">陈某赔偿后，小文的父亲文先生作为小文的法定代理人将学校诉至法院，要求事发操场所在的学校赔礼道歉，并支付医疗费、精神损害抚慰金等共计两万元。</seg>
        <seg id="7">近日，北京市海淀区人民法院对此案审理后认为，事发时学校在操场设置了防护网，已尽到适当的安全保障义务，且陈某已进行了赔偿，据此判决驳回了原告的诉讼请求。</seg>
        <seg id="8">文先生诉称，2019年暑假期间，他带小文在学校操场玩耍，当时正值垒球队在操场训练。</seg>
        <seg id="9">为了规避由此带来的风险，小文、文先生和其他众多小朋友及家长在垒球队指定的安全区域内活动。</seg>
        <seg id="10">但之后垒球队队员陈某在投球时脱手，导致垒球越过护网飞至上述安全区域内并击中小文后脑。</seg>
        <seg id="11">文先生立即带小文去医院治疗，被诊断为头外伤。</seg>
        <seg id="12">文先生认为，学校球场的设施不符合相关安全规定，未对球队及相关设施进行有效管理。</seg>
        <seg id="13">学校的过失导致上述事件发生，导致小文身心遭受巨大的痛苦，同时也给其家人带来了较大的痛苦，对此学校应当承担法律责任。</seg>
        <seg id="14">对此，校方辩称，学校已经在操场设置了防护网，并张贴了管理规定、训练通知，告知进入操场须与训练场地保持安全距离并提醒注意自身安全，原告也不能证明学校“未尽到安全保障义务”，所以不同意赔偿。</seg>
        <seg id="15">法院审理后认为，事发的场地系涉案大学对公众免费开放的场地，学校虽对操场的管理存在安全保障义务，但这种安全保障义务仅需达到一般的注意义务即可。</seg>
        <seg id="16">事发时学校在操场设置了防护网，已经尽到了适当的安全保障义务，且陈某也按照此前达成的赔偿协议向小文赔偿了医疗费、交通费等各项损失两千余元，双方约定此次纠纷一次性解决。</seg>
        <seg id="17">事后，小文家长再次主张学校赔偿，于法无据，法院判决驳回了原告的全部诉请。</seg>
        <seg id="18">宣判后，双方均未上诉，该判决现已生效。</seg>
        <seg id="19">根据我国侵权责任法第37条规定，学校作为公共场所的管理人，负有安全保障义务；在第三人的行为造成他人损害的情况下，第三人承担侵权责任，而未尽到安全保障义务的公共场所管理人应当承担相应的补充责任。</seg>
        <seg id="20">法官称，由于作为公共场所的管理人，最有可能了解整个场所的实际情况、预见可能发生的危险和损害，从而最有可能采取必要措施防止损失的发生或者减轻损害的程度，且避免和减轻损害发生的成本最低，故而法律规定由其承担从事社会活动相应的保障义务。</seg>
        <seg id="21">本案中，对于向公众免费开放的操场中不特定的进入人群，学校所负的安全保障义务应与其从事的社会活动相适应，具体而言，主要是应采取基本的安全措施并对于隐蔽性危险负有告知义务。</seg>
        <seg id="22">司法实践中，也不宜对公共场所管理人苛以过高的安全保障义务。</seg>
        <seg id="23">如果学校已经采取了设置防护网且尽到告知义务，则可以认定学校不具有过错，不应承担法律责任。</seg>
        <seg id="24">此外，对于第三人侵权，即使学校等公共场所的管理者未尽到安全保障义务，其承担的责任也是作为一种损害赔偿的补充，根据最新颁布的民法典，管理者承担补充责任后，还可以向第三人追偿。</seg>
        <seg id="25">故在此类事故中，受害者在已经收到直接侵权人的赔偿后，不应再扩大求偿范围。</seg>

        <seg id="2">2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo</seg>
        <seg id="3">Hit on Sports Ground, Child Sues University After Compensation is Paid</seg>
        <seg id="4">Reported by, Zhao Yifan</seg>
        <seg id="5">When playing on sports ground of an university, 3-year old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by a softball thrown by Chen from the softball team.</seg>
        <seg id="6">After being compensated by Chen for the accident, Xiaowen’s father, acting as Xiaowen’s legal guardian, sued the university in court, demanding an apology for what happened on the sports ground and a total of 20,000 yuan for medical bills and emotional distress.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Recently, the People’s Court of Haidian District in Beijing heard the case and believed the university fulfilled its obligation to provide appropriate safety assurance by setting up a protective barrier at the sports ground; in addition, Chen had already compensated for the accident, and therefore, the claims of the plaintiff were dismissed.</seg>
        <seg id="8">As Mr. Wen claims, he took Xiaowen to the sports ground of the university during summer vacation in 2019, and the softball team was training on the sports ground at the same time.</seg>
        <seg id="9">To avoid potential risks, Xiaowen and Mr. Wen and other parents and children were playing in a safety area designated by the softball team.</seg>
        <seg id="10">However, later when Chen, a member of the softball team, was throwing the ball, it slipped out of his hand, went over the protective barrier into the safety area, and hit Xiaowen in the back of her head.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Mr. Wen took Xiaowen to the hospital immediately, and she was diagnosed as having head trauma.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Mr. Wen believes the sports field facilities are not in line with safety regulations and the university failed to effectively manage the softball team and relevant facilities.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It was negligence of the university that led to the incident, which caused physical and mental distress for Xiaowen and her family, hence the university should take legal responsibility.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Against these accusations, the university argued that it has set up protective barrier around the sports field and posted management regulations and training notices informing people to keep a safe distance from the training field when entering the sports ground and to be aware of their personal safety, and because the plaintiff couldn’t prove the university “didn’t fulfill safety assurance obligations”, the university refused to pay compensation.</seg>
        <seg id="15">After hearing the case, the court believed the venue where the incident took place is open to public for free, and though the university bears safety assurance obligations for the sports ground, the extent of its obligations were merely to have general notices.</seg>
        <seg id="16">When the incident took place, there was a protective barrier set up by the university on the sports ground, meaning the appropriate safety assurance obligations were fulfilled, and Chen paid over 2,000 yuan in compensation for Xiaowen’s medical bill, transportation, and other losses according to the compensation agreement reached, so the two parities agreed to settle their dispute once and for all.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Afterwards, Xiaowen’s parents’ claims for compensation from the university was found to be groundless, and the court ruled to dismiss all claims of the plaintiff.</seg>
        <seg id="18">After neither party decided to appeal, the verdict became effective.</seg>
        <seg id="19">According to Article 37 of Tort Liability Law, as the manager of a public place, the university bears safety assurance obligations; and when actions of a third party cause damages to others, the third party takes tort liability, while manager of the public place that fails to fulfill safety assurance obligations takes complementary liabilities.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The judge stated that because manager of the public place is the party most likely to know the actual state of the site, and to foresee potential dangers and harms, it is the most likely party to take necessary measures to prevent losses from happening or reduce damages and to keep the cost of damage prevention or reduction to a minimum, meaning the law requires it to bear the appropriate safety assurance obligations when engaging in social activities.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In this case, for the non-specific group of people entering the sports ground open to public for free, the school’s safety assurance obligation were in line with the social activities it was engaged in, specifically which were primarily to take basic safety measures and to inform people of hidden dangers.</seg>
        <seg id="22">In juridical practice, it’s not advised to make safety assurance obligations too high or too strict for the managers of public places.</seg>
        <seg id="23">If the university has set up a protective barrier and fulfilled its duty to inform, the university is considered not at fault and does not bear legal responsibility.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Furthermore, as to third party tort, even if the manager of public places such as a university doesn’t fulfill its safety assurance obligations, its liability is complementary to damage compensation; according to the new Civil Code, the manager can claim compensation from the third party after assuming complementary liability.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Therefore, the victim must not expand the scope of the claim after receiving compensation from the directly liable party in this kind of accident.</seg>

        <seg id="1">今天我想向各位展示 未来我们制作东西的方式。</seg>
        <seg id="2">我相信很快我们的建筑和机器 将能自我组装， 自我复制和自我修复。</seg>
        <seg id="3">因此我要向各位展示 我所认为的制造业的当前状况， 接着再将其与一些自然系统比较。</seg>
        <seg id="4">那么在当前的制造业中，我们有摩天大楼 —— 两年半的时间， 50万至上百万个部分， 非常复杂， 使用了在钢铁，混凝土和玻璃方面的新技术。</seg>
        <seg id="5">我们有令人激动的机器， 可以带我们进入太空—— 五年时间，两百五十万个部分。</seg>
        <seg id="6">但另一方面，如果看看自然系统， 我们有拥有两百万种类型的 蛋白质， 能在一万纳秒内折叠起来， 我们能在大约一小时内 对带有三十亿碱基对的DNA进行复制。</seg>
        <seg id="7">这就是我们 自然系统的复杂性， 但它们非常高效， 比我们建造的任何东西都要高效， 比我们能建造的任何东西都要复杂。</seg>
        <seg id="8">它们在能源方面更加高效。</seg>
        <seg id="9">它们很少犯错。</seg>
        <seg id="10">他们能自我修复保持长寿。</seg>
        <seg id="11">关于自然系统有件超级有意思的事情。</seg>
        <seg id="12">如果我们能将其 转换为我们的建筑环境， 那么我们构建事物的方式就会有很大的潜力。</seg>
        <seg id="13">我认为关键是自我组装。</seg>
        <seg id="14">如果我们想要在自身的身体环境中利用自我组装， 我认为有四个关键因素。</seg>
        <seg id="15">第一个是，我们需要解码 我们所要建造的东西的所有的复杂度 —— 也就是我们的建筑和机器。</seg>
        <seg id="16">我们需要把它们解码成简单的序列 —— 基本上就是我们的建筑运作的DNA。</seg>
        <seg id="17">接着我们需要可编程的部分 这部分能接受这一序列 并用于折叠或是重塑。</seg>
        <seg id="18">我们需要一些能量来进行激活， 使我们的这些部分能够依照程序折叠起来。</seg>
        <seg id="19">我们需要一些类型的纠错冗余 以保证我们成功建造的就是我们想要的。</seg>
        <seg id="20">因此，我要向各位展示一些 我和我的同事正在进行的 要实现这种自我组装的未来的项目。</seg>
        <seg id="21">头两个项目是MacroBot和DeciBot。</seg>
        <seg id="22">这些项目都是大规模可重构机器人 —— 8英尺，12英尺长的蛋白质。</seg>
        <seg id="23">它们嵌入机电设备，传感器。</seg>
        <seg id="24">你需要把想要折叠的方式解码成， 解码成一系列角度 —— 负120度，负120度，0度，0度， 120度，负120度，——这类的东西； 一系列角度，或转向， 可以用电线把这个次序传过去。</seg>
        <seg id="25">每个单元获取自己的消息 —— 比如负120. 它进行旋转，检查是否旋转到位 然后把序列传给它的邻居。</seg>
        <seg id="26">有许多杰出的科学家， 工程师，设计师为这个项目工作。</seg>
        <seg id="27">我认为这一项目真的揭示出： 这真的可扩展么？</seg>
        <seg id="28">我是说，花费数千美元许多人时 来制造这个八英尺的机器人。</seg>
        <seg id="29">我们真的能扩大它么？我们真的能在每个部分中都嵌入机器人么？</seg>
        <seg id="30">下一个问题是 看看被动性， 或被动地尝试让重组具有可编程性。</seg>
        <seg id="31">但它更进了一步， 它尝试进行实际计算。</seg>
        <seg id="32">基本上嵌入了多数计算的基础构建模块， 数字逻辑门， 直接进入各个部分。</seg>
        <seg id="33">这是与非门。</seg>
        <seg id="34">每个要用于计算的门上 都有一个四面体， 有两个输入四面体。</seg>
        <seg id="35">其中一个是来自用户的输入，就像你在构建砖块。</seg>
        <seg id="36">另一个是来之前前放好的一块砖的输入。</seg>
        <seg id="37">接着它会给出三维空间的输出。</seg>
        <seg id="38">这意味着 用户以他们想要的方式堆砌砖块。</seg>
        <seg id="39">它依据之前所做的 和你的指令进行计算。</seg>
        <seg id="40">现在它开始在三维空间内移动 —— 上或者下。</seg>
        <seg id="41">看左面，[1,1] 的输入等于0输出，表示向下。</seg>
        <seg id="42">在右边， [0,0] 的输入是1输出，表示向上。</seg>
        <seg id="43">因此这真正的的意味是 我们的结构中现在包含了 我们想要构建的蓝图。</seg>
        <seg id="44">因此关于想要构建的事物的信息已经全部嵌入其中。</seg>
        <seg id="45">这意味着我们有了某种形式的自我复制。</seg>
        <seg id="46">对这种情况，我称之为自我导向复制， 因为你的结构中包含了精确的蓝图。</seg>
        <seg id="47">如果遇到错误，你可以替换一个部分。</seg>
        <seg id="48">所有的本地信息都嵌入其中，告诉你如何修复它。</seg>
        <seg id="49">因此你有个可以攀爬的东西，能读出它 并一个一个的输出。</seg>
        <seg id="50">它是直接嵌入的；没有外部指令输入。</seg>
        <seg id="51">我要展示的最后一个项目名为偏心链条， 它可能是我们现在看到的被动自我装配系统中 最令人激动的例子。</seg>
        <seg id="52">它具有可重构性 和可编程性 使它成了为了一个完全地被动系统。</seg>
        <seg id="53">基本上就是你有了一连串的元素。</seg>
        <seg id="54">每个元素都是完全相同的， 且它们是偏心的。</seg>
        <seg id="55">每个链条，或每个元素想要向右转或是向左转。</seg>
        <seg id="56">如果你要装配链条，需要为它编程。</seg>
        <seg id="57">要告诉每个单元是要左转还是右转。</seg>
        <seg id="58">当你摇动这个链条时， 它就折叠起来 编程你所为它编码的任何结构 —— 因此这种情况下，一个螺旋体， 火这种情况， 两个相连的立方体。</seg>
        <seg id="59">基本上你可以在 三维空间内编程 —— 或是一维、二维 —— 这链条是完全被动的。</seg>
        <seg id="60">这向我们预示了怎样的未来呢？</seg>
        <seg id="61">我认为这告诉我们 这些在我们的身体结构、我们的建筑和机器中 这种自我装配、自我复制和自我修复的可能性。</seg>
        <seg id="62">在这些部分中有新的可编程性。</seg>
        <seg id="63">从中你能获得计算的新可能性。</seg>
        <seg id="64">我们将有空间计算。</seg>
        <seg id="65">想象一下我们的建筑、桥梁、机器， 所有的砖块都能进行实际计算。</seg>
        <seg id="66">多么令人惊奇的并行计算和分布式计算能力和 新的设计可能性啊。</seg>
        <seg id="67">这是项令人激动的潜力。</seg>
        <seg id="68">我认为这些我向各位展示的项目 仅仅是迈向未来的一小步， 如果我们为一个新的自我组装的世界 实现了这些新技术的话。</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="3">So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare that to some natural systems.</seg>
        <seg id="4">So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time], 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.</seg>
        <seg id="5">We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.</seg>
        <seg id="6">But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems, we have proteins that have two million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour.</seg>
        <seg id="7">So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.</seg>
        <seg id="8">They're far more efficient in terms of energy.</seg>
        <seg id="9">They hardly ever make mistakes.</seg>
        <seg id="10">And they can repair themselves for longevity.</seg>
        <seg id="11">So there's something super interesting about natural systems.</seg>
        <seg id="12">And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.</seg>
        <seg id="13">And I think the key to that is self-assembly.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there's four key factors.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.</seg>
        <seg id="18">We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate, allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.</seg>
        <seg id="19">And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.</seg>
        <seg id="20">So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.</seg>
        <seg id="22">So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.</seg>
        <seg id="23">They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.</seg>
        <seg id="24">You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor.</seg>
        <seg id="26">So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project.</seg>
        <seg id="27">And I think it really brings to light: Is this really scalable?</seg>
        <seg id="28">I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?</seg>
        <seg id="30">The next one questions that and looks at passive nature, or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.</seg>
        <seg id="31">But it goes a step further, and it tries to have actual computation.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts.</seg>
        <seg id="33">So this is a NAND gate.</seg>
        <seg id="34">You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing, and you have two input tetrahedrons.</seg>
        <seg id="35">One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.</seg>
        <seg id="37">And then it gives you an output in 3D space.</seg>
        <seg id="38">So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.</seg>
        <seg id="39">It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do.</seg>
        <seg id="40">And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down.</seg>
        <seg id="41">So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.</seg>
        <seg id="42">On the right-hand side, [0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.</seg>
        <seg id="44">So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.</seg>
        <seg id="45">So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.</seg>
        <seg id="46">In this case I call it self-guided replication, because your structure contains the exact blueprints.</seg>
        <seg id="47">If you have errors, you can replace a part.</seg>
        <seg id="48">All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.</seg>
        <seg id="49">So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.</seg>
        <seg id="51">So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.</seg>
        <seg id="52">So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.</seg>
        <seg id="53">So basically you have a chain of elements.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Each element is completely identical, and they're biased.</seg>
        <seg id="55">So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="56">So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.</seg>
        <seg id="57">You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.</seg>
        <seg id="59">So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.</seg>
        <seg id="60">So what does this tell us about the future?</seg>
        <seg id="61">I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.</seg>
        <seg id="62">There's new programmability in these parts.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And from that you have new possibilities for computing.</seg>
        <seg id="64">We'll have spatial computing.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute.</seg>
        <seg id="66">That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.</seg>
        <seg id="67">So it's exciting potential for this.</seg>
        <seg id="68">So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Thank you.</seg>

        <seg id="2">It was recently announced that “Running Out of Time 2” will be released on December 24th, making it the first film to set its release date during the winter holiday season.</seg>
        <seg id="3">This sequel, again directed by Liu Qitao and produced by Andy Lau, presents a brand-new story in the series.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Sources say that the addition of a “nuclear bomb” to the plot raises the stakes the challenge faced by these demolition experts, the stunning scenes in the trailers have audiences waiting on tenterhooks, and the shot of the mushroom cloud enveloping the airport is especially shocking.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Three years ago, the first “Running Out of Time” produced by the original team earned the highest box office total of the May Day holiday season, won 7 nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards, and made “Qiu Litao x Andy Lau” a golden partnership to film lovers everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Now, people are hoping that these partners can produce new sparks on the silver screen with “Running Out of Time 2”.</seg>
        <seg id="7">“Running Out of Time 2” brings us an entirely new story: former bomb disposal expert Pan Chengfeng (played by Andy Lau) passes out at a bombing crime scene, causing the police to consider him a suspect.</seg>
        <seg id="8">To discover the truth, he is forced to ask his bomb disposal expert friend Dong Zhuowen (played by Sean Lau) for help.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Pang Ling, the female detective assigned to the case and Pan Chengfeng’s former girlfriend (played Ni Ni) is also pulled into the fray.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Pan Chengfeng is still a bomb disposal expert, but in the release date announcement trailer, Andy Lau’s new role is more complex: after breaking his leg, he attaches a prosthetic leg, and then defuses a bomb while being chased by Sean Lau and taking instructions from his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Just what is the relationship between the three characters, what does Andy Lau do in the Hong Kong hotel, what kind of case is he involved in, and what happened to his bomb disposal career are all questions to which audiences crave answers.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Sources tell us that the film’s highlights include on-location shooting at world-famous Hong Kong landmarks, and coupled with the industry-leading special effects team, we expect the film to deliver a mind-blowing cinematic experience.</seg>

        <seg id="29">这些是百合花的花粉囊， 非常巧妙， 因此当毫不知情的昆虫 落于其上时， 花粉囊翻转过来，带着许多花粉 击打在昆虫背部，这样就能跟随昆虫到其他植物那里。</seg>
        <seg id="30">有一种兰花 看起来就像是有下颚一般。 在某种程度上说，它的确有；它强迫昆虫爬过， 沾上花粉，并把花粉带往别的地方。</seg>
        <seg id="31">兰花：至少有 两万种兰花 -- 多种多样的令人惊异。</seg>
        <seg id="32">它们有各种各样的花招。</seg>
        <seg id="33">它们必须尝试并吸引传粉者 帮助它们完成这一过程。</seg>
        <seg id="34">这株兰花，被称为达尔文的兰花， 因为它曾被达尔文研究 并在他看到这种兰花时给出了奇妙的预测。 可以看到这儿有一个很长的花蜜管 从兰花中 垂下来。</seg>
        <seg id="35">基本上昆虫不得不做的是 -- 我们来到花的当中 -- 它把口器刺入 中间的部分 一路向下知道花蜜管 以得到花蜜。</seg>
        <seg id="36">达尔文说，看看这花， “我猜测有些事物与其共同进化了。”</seg>
        <seg id="37">毫无疑问， 就是昆虫。</seg>
        <seg id="38">我的意思时，通常它都是卷起来的， 但它伸直以后， 看起来是这样的。</seg>
        <seg id="39">现在可以想象一下 如果花蜜 这种如此有价值的事物 对植物来说生产的代价高昂 且又能吸引许多传粉者， 那么，就如在人类性行为中的那样， 人们或许开始相互欺骗。</seg>
        <seg id="40">它们或许会说，“我有些花蜜。你想来拿点么？”</seg>
        <seg id="41">这是一株植物。</seg>
        <seg id="42">这株植物 为南非的昆虫所喜爱。 它们进化出了长长的口器 以获取底部的花蜜。</seg>
        <seg id="43">这是个模仿者。</seg>
        <seg id="44">这种植物在模仿前一种植物。</seg>
        <seg id="45">有一种长着长口器的苍蝇 它从假冒者那儿没得到任何花蜜。 因为假冒者没给它任何花蜜。它以为它可以得到。</seg>
        <seg id="46">因此，不但苍蝇 没有从假冒的植物那儿得到花蜜， 而且 -- 如果你非常近的观察 头的顶部，你会看到那儿有些花粉 这些花粉将被传播到其他植株上， 如果没有植物学家过来 把它粘到一张蓝色卡片上的话。</seg>
        <seg id="47">（笑声） 这种谎言遍布整个植物王国。</seg>
        <seg id="48">这朵带着黑点的花： 它们或许在我们看来像是黑点， 但我告诉各位，对适当物种的雄性昆虫来说， 这看起来像是两只 非常非常性感的雌性。</seg>
        <seg id="49">（笑声） 当昆虫到达并在上面着陆时， 把自己浸入花粉中，当然，这些花粉将会被它带到其他植物那儿去， 如果看看每个家庭都应该有的扫描电子显微镜的图像， 就能看到实际上那儿有些图案， 三维的图案。</seg>
        <seg id="50">它甚至能让昆虫感觉到舒服， 看起来也不错。</seg>
        <seg id="51">这些电子显微镜图像 -- 这是一朵兰花在伪装成一只昆虫 -- 你能看到对我们的眼睛来说， 结构的不同部分有着不同的色彩和不同的纹理, 而昆虫或许能感知到 非常非常不同的纹理。</seg>
        <seg id="52">这种兰花进化至能模仿 在一些甲壳虫身上看到的 有金属光泽的表面。</seg>
        <seg id="53">在扫描电子显微镜下 你能看到这表面 -- 这与我们看过的其他表面非常不同。</seg>
        <seg id="54">有时整个植物会 模仿成一只昆虫，即使我们看来也像是昆虫。</seg>
        <seg id="55">我的意思是，我认为这看起来像是某种飞行的动物或野兽。</seg>
        <seg id="56">是美妙而神奇的事物。</seg>
        <seg id="57">这是它的聪明之处。它被称为黑曜石。</seg>
        <seg id="58">我认为它有时是狡猾的。</seg>
        <seg id="59">对于适合种类的蜜蜂来说， 这看起来像是另一只非常有侵略性的蜜蜂， 它会飞过来用头撞击它许多许多次，试着赶走它， 当然，这会让它沾上花粉。</seg>
        <seg id="60">它做的另一件事是 这种植物模仿成另一种 富含昆虫喜爱的 食物的兰花。</seg>
        <seg id="61">但其实什么也没有。</seg>
        <seg id="62">因此它在两个层面上进行欺骗 -- 真难以置信。</seg>
        <seg id="63">（笑声） 我们看到的是依兰， 有浓烈香味的部分。</seg>
        <seg id="64">实际上我之前闻到过。</seg>
        <seg id="65">这些花实际上没有必要这么艳丽。</seg>
        <seg id="66">它们散发出奇妙的香味 吸引任何有兴趣的昆虫。</seg>
        <seg id="67">这朵花闻起来不怎么样。</seg>
        <seg id="68">这朵花 实际上闻起来非常难闻 再提一次，这是进化而来， 它看起来像是腐肉。</seg>
        <seg id="69">因此苍蝇喜欢它。</seg>
        <seg id="70">苍蝇飞进去并帮其授粉。</seg>
        <seg id="71">这是白星海芋， 也被称作死马海芋。</seg>
        <seg id="72">我不知道死马闻起来什么味儿， 但这朵花或许闻起来非常像。</seg>

        <seg id="76">在上面产卵， 认为这是块很不错的腐肉， 没有意识到这儿可没有卵的食物，这些卵会死在这儿， 但同时这株植物会受益， 因为硬毛松开 苍蝇消失了， 授粉至另一朵花 -- 太奇妙了。</seg>
        <seg id="77">这是海芋植物，欧海芋， 斑叶阿若母，在这个国家称为延龄草。</seg>

        <seg id="80">如果看看它内部， 肉穗后面是个有点像大坝的东西， 苍蝇为热量所吸引 -- 这是种沸腾的挥发性化学物质，小虫 -- 它们被困在这一容器下面。</seg>
        <seg id="81">它们痛饮甜美的花蜜 接着都变得有点黏糊糊的。</seg>
        <seg id="82">在夜里它们被花粉覆盖， 由它们上面喷洒而下， 然后我们在上面看到的硬毛 变得枯萎让这些浑身花粉的小虫得以逃出 -- 真是难以置信。</seg>
        <seg id="83">如果你认为这是难以置信的，这一个是我的最爱。</seg>

        <seg id="87">它的雄蕊 有大约一英尺长。</seg>
        <seg id="88">它有一种 据我所知没任何其他植物拥有的能力， 当它盛开时 -- 这是在中间的肉穗 -- 大约两天时间， 它产生了某种程度的代谢变化 有些类似哺乳动物。</seg>

        <seg id="92">不仅是它将升温至155华氏度， 43或44摄氏度，两天， 而且它将保持恒温。</seg>
        <seg id="93">其中有一个温度调节机制 用于保持恒温。</seg>
        <seg id="94">为什么要这么做？我听到你们问。</seg>
        <seg id="95">目前你们还不知道， 有些甲壳虫就喜欢在这一温度下交配。</seg>
        <seg id="96">它们钻进去，沾满花粉。</seg>
        <seg id="97">（笑声） 植物在它们身上撒满花粉， 让它们离开，去授粉。</seg>
        <seg id="98">这是多么奇妙的事情啊。</seg>
        <seg id="99">现在我们认为 大多数传粉者是昆虫， 但实际上在热带地区， 许多鸟类和蝴蝶也进行传粉。</seg>
        <seg id="100">许多热带的花朵是红色的， 这是因为蝴蝶和鸟类 与我们相似，我们认为， 能非常好的看到红色。</seg>
        <seg id="101">但如果你看看光谱， 鸟类和我们，我们看到红色，绿色和蓝色 看到这一光谱。</seg>
        <seg id="102">昆虫看到绿色，蓝色和紫外线， 它们能看到各种明暗的紫外线。</seg>
        <seg id="103">在这后面还有些色彩。</seg>
        <seg id="104">“如果我们能看到那些颜色难道不好吗，”我听到你们问。</seg>
        <seg id="105">是的，我们能看到。</seg>
        <seg id="106">那么昆虫看到的是什么？</seg>
        <seg id="107">上周我拍了这些沙漠座莲的照片， 半日花属，在多塞特。</seg>
        <seg id="108">正如我们所看到的，这是些小黄花， 到处都是这种小黄花。</seg>
        <seg id="109">在可见光下它看起来是这样的。</seg>
        <seg id="110">如果去除红色看起来是这样。</seg>
        <seg id="111">多数蜜蜂无法感知红色。</seg>
        <seg id="112">接着我在我的镜头前放上紫外线滤镜 在紫外线特定的频率下 长时间的曝光， 就得到了这张照片。</seg>
        <seg id="113">这像是个真实的奇妙的靶心。</seg>
        <seg id="114">现在我们不知道 蜜蜂到底看到的是什么， 当我称之为红色时， 你们知道我在看什么。</seg>
        <seg id="115">我们无法知道其中发生了什么，不管是昆虫， 还是其他人类的脑中。</seg>
        <seg id="116">但对比度看起来大概是这样。 从背景中突显出来。</seg>
        <seg id="117">这是另一种小花 -- 位于不同的紫外线频率区间， 不同的滤镜 来匹配不同的传粉者。</seg>
        <seg id="118">它看起来大概是这样。</seg>
        <seg id="119">为了避免你们认为 所有黄色的花都有这一属性 -- 在拍摄的过程中没有损伤花朵； 只是把它贴在三脚架上， 没有摘下来 -- 在紫外光下， 看看这个。</seg>
        <seg id="120">这能作为防晒霜的基础， 因为防晒霜是通过吸收紫外光来起作用的。</seg>
        <seg id="121">因此或许其中的化学物质有些用处。</seg>
        <seg id="122">最后，这是一朵夜来香 是挪威的Bjorn Rorslett发给我的 -- 奇妙的隐藏模式。</seg>
        <seg id="123">我喜欢这种隐藏的方式。</seg>
        <seg id="124">我觉得这很有诗意。 这些照片是用紫外线滤镜拍摄的， 这种滤镜的主要用途是 天文学家用来拍摄金星 -- 实际上是金星上的云层。</seg>
        <seg id="125">这是这种滤镜的主要用途。</seg>
        <seg id="126">当然，金星是爱与生育之神， 这是花的物语。</seg>
        <seg id="127">正如花朵们花了这么多精力 尝试吸引传粉者接受它们的邀请， 不知何故，它们也成功地让我们相信其中含有丰富内涵 我们在出生和逝世时 相互送出花朵， 尤其是婚礼时， 当你想到它时， 就在这一刻内 基因物质从 迁移一个有机体到另一个。</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?</seg>
        <seg id="2">There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="3">And flowers are a real bugger.</seg>
        <seg id="4">They're really difficult for plants to produce.</seg>
        <seg id="5">They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Why would they go to that bother?</seg>
        <seg id="7">And the answer of course, like so many things in the world, is sex.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.</seg>
        <seg id="9">And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important -- there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.</seg>
        <seg id="10">You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Evolution works that way.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="17">And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance.</seg>
        <seg id="20">So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="21">But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The insects and other species can take the pollen, transfer it directly to where it's required.</seg>
        <seg id="23">So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship between insects and plants.</seg>
        <seg id="24">There's a symbiotic relationship there, whether it's flies or birds or bees, they're getting something in return, and that something in return is generally nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.</seg>
        <seg id="28">There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Orchids: there are 20,000, at least, species of orchids -- amazingly, amazingly diverse.</seg>
        <seg id="32">And they get up to all sorts of tricks.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.</seg>
        <seg id="35">And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this."</seg>
        <seg id="37">And sure enough, there's the insect.</seg>
        <seg id="38">And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators, then, just as in human sex, people might start to deceive.</seg>
        <seg id="40">They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"</seg>
        <seg id="41">Now this is a plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love, and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And this is the mimic.</seg>
        <seg id="44">So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.</seg>
        <seg id="45">And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.</seg>
        <seg id="46">So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.</seg>
        <seg id="49">(Laughter) And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.</seg>
        <seg id="50">So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good.</seg>
        <seg id="51">And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive.</seg>
        <seg id="52">And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And under the scanning electron microscope, you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It's a wonderful, amazing thing.</seg>
        <seg id="57">This one's clever. It's called obsidian.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I think of it as insidium sometimes.</seg>
        <seg id="59">To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="60">The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.</seg>
        <seg id="61">And this one doesn't have anything for them.</seg>
        <seg id="62">So it's deceiving on two levels -- fabulous.</seg>
        <seg id="63">(Laughter) Here we see ylang ylang, the component of many perfumes.</seg>
        <seg id="64">I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.</seg>
        <seg id="65">And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.</seg>
        <seg id="66">They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This one doesn't smell so good.</seg>
        <seg id="68">This is a flower that really, really smells pretty nasty and is designed, again, evolved, to look like carrion.</seg>
        <seg id="69">So flies love this.</seg>
        <seg id="70">They fly in and they pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum.</seg>
        <seg id="72">I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like, but this one probably smells pretty much like it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">It's really horrible.</seg>
        <seg id="74">And blowflies just can't help themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="75">They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it.</seg>
        <seg id="76">They lay their eggs in it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited, because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Here's arum, arum maculatum, "lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.</seg>
        <seg id="78">I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="79">This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="80">And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.</seg>
        <seg id="81">They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky.</seg>
        <seg id="82">At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.</seg>
        <seg id="84">This is the philodendron selloum.</seg>
        <seg id="85">For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">This is the most amazing thing.</seg>
        <seg id="87">That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long.</seg>
        <seg id="88">And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.</seg>
        <seg id="89">So instead of having starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat, metabolizing, about the rate of a small cat.</seg>
        <seg id="90">And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.</seg>
        <seg id="91">This thing does something else which is unusual.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it keeps constant temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="93">There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Now why does it do this, I hear you ask.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And they get inside, and they get it all on.</seg>
        <seg id="97">(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and off they go and pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="98">And what a wonderful thing it is.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Now most pollinators that we think about are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="100">And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.</seg>
        <seg id="101">But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="102">Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet.</seg>
        <seg id="103">So there's something that goes on off the end there.</seg>
        <seg id="104">And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is, I hear you ask.</seg>
        <seg id="105">Well yes we can.</seg>
        <seg id="106">So what is an insect seeing?</seg>
        <seg id="107">Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are little yellow flowers like we all see, little yellow flowers all over the place.</seg>
        <seg id="109">And this is what it looks like with visible light.</seg>
        <seg id="110">This is what it looks like if you take out the red.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Most bees don't perceive red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very, very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got.</seg>
        <seg id="113">And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.</seg>
        <seg id="114">Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees, any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.</seg>
        <seg id="119">Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.</seg>
        <seg id="120">And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.</seg>
        <seg id="121">So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="123">And I love the idea of something hidden.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think there's something poetic here, that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter, the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus.</seg>
        <seg id="125">That's the main use of that filter.</seg>
        <seg id="126">Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story.</seg>
        <seg id="127">And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.</seg>
        <seg id="128">Thank you very much.</seg>
        <seg id="129">(Applause)</seg>

        <seg id="2">In an interview with a reporter from Ecns.cn, 53-year-old Li Daiguo said that his grandfathers used to fish in the Longxi River, and that he had been fishing with his father since the age of 11, shaking his boat, and traveling along the Longxi River from Liangping, Chongqing to Changshou, journeys that would last for over ten days every time he left his home, and he relied on fishing to make a living.</seg>
        <seg id="3">However, since 1997, as the rural population has gradually flowed into the town, there are increasing number of residents in Gao'anchang town, which has caused increasingly serious environmental pollution.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Paper mills, chemical plants, and breeding farms were built along the Longxi River, which also polluted the river.</seg>
        <seg id="5">By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River became a stinking ditch.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"The scales of the fish are black, and their stomachs are black, too. "</seg>
        <seg id="7">Li Daiguo said that fishing has become more and more difficult after the river was polluted.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The local government began to make great efforts to control the pollution of the Longxi River, including clearing the river, patrolling on the river, and managing and protecting aquatic resources.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Li Daiguo also quit fishing and became a member of the river inspection team to manage and protect aquatic resources.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Starting from January 1, 2020, the aquatic life reserve of Chongqing and related water areas in the main urban area have implemented a total ban on fishing.</seg>
        <seg id="11">According to data from the Chongqing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform, as of now, there are 3,403 fishing boats that have quit fishing and 4,643 fishing boats that have signed retreat agreements, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year mission respectively.</seg>

        <seg id="14">The pension insurance coverage covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of the fishermen who have quit fishing.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In the next step, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special rectification actions, accelerate the cleanup and rectification of the utilization projects on the shoreline of the Yangtze River, complete a new round of surveys on sewage outflow of the Yangtze River and carry out corresponding rectification actions, basically complete the "three phosphorus" rectification tasks (referring to phosphate mines, phosphorus chemical industry, and phosphogypsum reservoirs), conduct small hydropower clean-up and rectification, promote the special forestation and greening activities on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the results of the special rectification of illegal docks and illegal sand mining on the main stream of the Yangtze River, and further promote the ban on fishing and fishing-quitting work on the Yangtze River.</seg>

        <seg id="3">以色列加强对疫情反复的防控</seg>
        <seg id="4">新冠肺炎疫情暴发初期，以色列的防控措施成效明显。</seg>
        <seg id="5">然而，随着防控措施的逐渐解禁，近期以色列国内的新冠肺炎确诊人数有明显上升之势，以色列政府已多次采取紧急措施加强对疫情的防控。</seg>
        <seg id="6">2月28日，以色列本土确诊第一例新冠肺炎病例，以迅速采取了关闭所有出入境口岸，暂停非必要行业，学校改为网上授课，限制公共交通和非必要社交活动，封锁疫情严重城市，军警联合维护防控举措等。</seg>
        <seg id="7">这一系列措施很快取得了积极成效，至5月中旬，以色列单日新增新冠肺炎确诊病例一度回落至个位数。</seg>
        <seg id="8">随着疫情得到控制，以色列各项防控措施全面解封，自6月以来，新冠肺炎新增确诊人数逐渐反弹。</seg>
        <seg id="9">特别是进入7月后，疫情扩散蔓延速度不断加快。</seg>
        <seg id="10">近日来，以色列每日新增病例有8天在1500人以上，截至7月25日发稿时，以当日新增病例达916人。</seg>
        <seg id="11">截至7月25日，以色列已有确诊病例59745人，死亡人数448人。</seg>
        <seg id="12">面对疫情的迅猛反弹，以色列政府多次采取紧急措施加强对疫情的防控。</seg>
        <seg id="13">7月6日，在确诊病例数突破3万后，以色列政府关闭了健身房、游泳池、酒吧、夜总会等公共娱乐场所，同时出台了限制公共交通政策，规定每辆公交车的乘客最多不能超过20人。</seg>
        <seg id="14">17日，以政府宣布了包括周末实施“封城”等在内的一系列新的限制措施，规定在每周五17时至每周日5时期间实施“封城”。</seg>
        <seg id="15">在此期间，民众可以外出，但商店、购物中心、理发店、美容院、图书馆、动物园、博物馆、展览馆、游泳池和旅游景点等场所将关闭，而超市、药店等基本服务场所将保持开放。</seg>
        <seg id="16">同时，在所有日期和时段内，禁止10人以上的集会，健身房、工作室等场所将关闭，餐馆和咖啡厅禁止堂食，仅允许提供外卖服务。</seg>
        <seg id="17">同时，以色列民众未对疫情的严重性予以足够重视，没能与政府在抗击疫情方面形成合力。</seg>
        <seg id="18">在以色列疫情出现反复后，许多民众因政府防控措施影响自身经济利益而上街抗议游行。</seg>
        <seg id="19">7月11日，上万人在特拉维夫举行示威游行，认为抗疫政策影响经济。</seg>
        <seg id="20">21日晚间，又有数千名抗议者聚集在耶路撒冷的内塔尼亚胡总理官邸前，抗议内塔尼亚胡总理颁布禁止餐馆、咖啡厅堂食等防控措施又不给出相应补偿。</seg>
        <seg id="21">此外，许多民众在户外活动时也未遵守佩戴口罩、保持两米安全社交距离等规定，为避免因未佩戴口罩被警察罚款，不少民众仅将口罩戴在下巴上或者挂在手腕上。</seg>
        <seg id="22">疫情反复期间，学校是新冠病毒扩散的重灾区，而据记者近日对此间幼儿园走访发现，幼儿园的老师和学生均未按政府要求佩戴口罩，也没有相互保持两米安全社交距离，为大量师生感染病毒埋下隐患。</seg>
        <seg id="23">以色列国家安全委员会对抗疫情专家顾问团成员埃利·瓦克斯曼教授认为，以色列正走向“危险局势”，指出以色列目前采取的疫情防控措施还不够，应关闭所有休闲、娱乐活动场所和暑期学校，以控制疫情进一步扩散。</seg>
        <seg id="24">瓦克斯曼表示，以色列缺乏抗击疫情的总体计划，议会和政府各部门应尽快摒弃各自的利益考虑，在对抗疫情问题上达成一致，制定包括不同部门相关限制措施的明确步骤。</seg>

        <seg id="2">2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: Guangming Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo</seg>
        <seg id="3">Israel strengthens measures to prevent epidemic from recurring</seg>
        <seg id="4">At the beginning of the epidemic outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.</seg>
        <seg id="5">However, with the gradual lifting of the ban, the number of confirmed cases in Israel has recently increased significantly, and the Israeli government has taken several emergency measures to strengthen its epidemic prevention and control.</seg>
        <seg id="6">On February 28, the first case was confirmed in Israel and prompt measures were taken to close all entry and exit points, suspend non-essential industries, and urge all schools to take classes online; moreover, they restricted public transportation and non-essential social activities, sealed off cities with severe outbreaks, and combined military and police efforts to maintain effective control and prevention measures.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, and by mid-May, the daily number of confirmed cases in Israel dropped to the single digits.</seg>
        <seg id="8">As the outbreak was brought under control, the blockade was completely lifted and the number of new confirmed cases has gradually seen a recurrence since June.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In particular, in July, the spread of the epidemic has accelerated since the beginning of the month.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Recently, the number of new confirmed cases in Israel has been above 1,500 per day for eight days, and by the time of this report on July 25, the number of new confirmed cases reached 916.</seg>
        <seg id="11">As of July 25, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 death cases in Israel.</seg>
        <seg id="12">In the face of this rapid recurrence, the Israeli government has taken several emergency measures to strengthen epidemic prevention and control.</seg>
        <seg id="13">On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a policy of limiting public transport to a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.</seg>
        <seg id="14">On July 17, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including a "city lockdown" on weekends, from 17:00 every Friday to 5:00 every Sunday.</seg>
        <seg id="15">During this period, people will be allowed to go out but the shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed; however, places providing basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.</seg>
        <seg id="16">In the meantime, gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned around the clock every day, gyms, studios, and other places will be closed, and restaurants and cafes will be closed for dine-in food, with only takeaway services allowed.</seg>
        <seg id="17">As yet, the Israeli public is not fully aware of the seriousness of the epidemic and fails to cooperate with the government in fighting against it.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In spite of the epidemic’s recurrence in Israel, many people have taken to the streets in protest at the government's control measures that affected the public economic interests.</seg>
        <seg id="19">On July 11, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti-epidemic policies were affecting the economy.</seg>
        <seg id="20">On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against the ban on dine-in food in restaurants and cafes and the lack of compensation.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In addition, many people did not comply with the rules to wear masks and maintain a safe social distance of two meters when going outdoors, and many people only wore masks on their chins or hung them on their wrists to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing them.</seg>
        <seg id="22">During the epidemic recurrence, schools have been the most affected places by the COVID-19; according to a recent reporter’s visit to a kindergarten, it was found that teachers and students did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they keep a safe social distance of two meters, thus creating a potential risk for a large number of teachers and students to be exposed to the virus.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the expert advisory group of the National Security Council of Israel on combating the epidemic, believes that Israel is heading towards a "dangerous situation", adding that the measures currently being taken to prevent and control the epidemic are insufficient and that all leisure and entertainment activities and summer schools should be closed in order to control the further spread of the epidemic.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Waxman states that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic and that the Knesset and all government departments should put aside their own interests and agree on a clear step to combat the epidemic, including clear restrictions in different sectors.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Despite the fact that he has had difficulty walking over the past two years, the 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still expects to "come here every now and then to have a good time".</seg>
        <seg id="3">This is an inconspicuous courtyard in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan, but unlike other ordinary farmhouses, songs of melodious Shanxi opera are often heard from this one, as well as terrific shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Shaanxi opera and Meihu plays.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The owner of the courtyard is called Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.</seg>
        <seg id="5">More than 10 years ago, he began to design and construct the cultural courtyard because of his passion for shadow plays and opera.</seg>
        <seg id="6">With the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, villagers' cultural life has become much richer.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Before this reporter walked into the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, the melody of Shanxi opera was already wafting through the air.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The person who performing the Shaanxi opera excerpts for the villagers is Bo Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village.</seg>
        <seg id="9">She has had a passion for Shanxi opera since childhood, is now well known locally, and she has free time, she comes to the cultural courtyard to perform for the villagers.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Recently, she has also taken up live webcasting.</seg>
        <seg id="11">“It's a blessing to have a stage where more people can see my performance," she said .</seg>
        <seg id="12">On the stage, the performers sing well and follow the instrumental melody, and despite being amateurs, their enthusiasm is undiminished.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Just like the rustic nature of the farmhouse, besides the Shanxi opera, the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard is full of "grassroots" art and intangible cultural heritage.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The courtyard also has a collection of over 300 items from different eras, including farming equipment, traditional and handmade sculptures, paper-cutting, embroidery and shadow puppets.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Liang Yun leads the reporter into the exhibition hall, which displays his collection of old objects, such as old wine pots, Sanxianzi (stringed instruments), and spindle wheels.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural courtyard?</seg>
        <seg id="17">"Shadow puppetry is my family's craft passed down from a long time ago, and I have been learning this since I was 15 years old. .</seg>
        <seg id="18">The Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard was established in 2012 and became the first rural "Intangible Cultural Heritage Exhibition Hall" in Ningxia, as well as a demonstration courtyard for protecting intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan.</seg>
        <seg id="19">In addition to the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, more than 120 cultural courtyards have appeared in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City, as well as 79 folk performance groups, of which there are more than 50 cultural courtyards of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Courtyard, Wang Yonghong Cultural Courtyard, and Yang Lang Cultural Courtyard, which are dispersed all over towns and streets in the Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 performers.</seg>
        <seg id="20">These grassroots artists are active in their fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying the public’s cultural needs.</seg>
        <seg id="21">"As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be utterly forgotten. .</seg>

        <seg id="4">以“谍战剧”为观众熟知的演员柳云龙在剧中突破形象，挑战了一位颇具喜感的“口吃特工”。</seg>
        <seg id="5">近几年，《伪装者》《面具》《风筝》等剧的走红，都证明着谍战类型剧有着旺盛的生命力。</seg>
        <seg id="6">不同于以往的谍战作品，《胜算》放眼世界，将故事背景外延至苏联远东战场。</seg>
        <seg id="7">它以1944年抗日战争最后阶段为背景，讲述了中共秘密情报工作人员唐飞（柳云龙饰），在中国地下党林河省委书记和苏联远东情报局局长的领导下，执行苏军远东情报局的“穆丹乌拉”谋略行动的故事。</seg>
        <seg id="8">不少谍战剧中，男主角作为高级间谍，一出场就是帅气、高智商、成熟的完美形象。</seg>
        <seg id="9">但在柳云龙看来，这样的人并不适合做间谍，“间谍应该是那种放人堆儿里根本找不着的人，如果一出场就是那种很装很帅的形象，恨不得所有人都要注意你，还能潜伏吗？《风筝》里有一句台词，‘你不来抓我，我都忘记自己是个国民党了’，间谍要去精英化。”</seg>
        <seg id="10">所以在《胜算》中，柳云龙别出心裁地将他饰演的主人公唐飞设计成一个带有喜感的“口吃特工”。</seg>
        <seg id="11">《胜算》中的另一方阵营，是由梁冠华饰演的日本人福原和李立群饰演的警察厅厅长方世宝合力撑起来的。</seg>
        <seg id="12">一南一北两位实力派戏骨，为整部剧增添了许多高手过招的看点。</seg>
        <seg id="13">导演殷飞用“飙戏”一词形容剧中李立群与柳云龙的对手戏，“绝对是飙戏，他们二位特别默契，他们身上的这种默契对我来讲非常有冲击力。很多时候他们的戏都是‘现挂’的，例如我们只写了半页纸的长度，拍摄时我不喊停，他俩就能一直演下去。”</seg>
        <seg id="14">高手之间互不抢戏，导演也不去搅戏，当演员都在角色之中并保证自己人物状态的时候，不仅可以从人物角度出发去塑造角色，还能给观众带来更多的观看可能性，殷飞说这样的戏才够出彩。</seg>
        <seg id="15">剧中，还能看到许多“柳氏谍战剧”中熟悉的面庞，《风筝》中名震一时、威风凛凛的“山城F4”，在《胜算》中也聚齐了三位。</seg>
        <seg id="16">曾饰演宋孝安和赵简之的侯煜与刘名洋，此次再度饰演唐飞的左膀右臂。</seg>
        <seg id="17">导演殷飞介绍道，“这两个人身上没有劣根性，他们只不过在那个时代、那个环境中随波逐流了。”</seg>
        <seg id="18">柳云龙也主动提出，“我们要有人情味。这个人情味就是指我身边的人一定有好的有坏的，坏的人是敌人，但也要把他们发展起来，我们的队伍也要壮大起来。”</seg>
        <seg id="19">剧中这两人的走向结局也是柳云龙精心设计过的，他相信将给观众交上一份满意的答卷。</seg>

        <seg id="1">“Liu’s Spy TV Series” Returns with The Possibility of Victory with Performances from Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun - Xinhua Net</seg>
        <seg id="2">The 40-episode spy TV series The Possibility of Victory will be broadcast on Beijing TV on July 16.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The Possibility of Victory is adapted from real historical facts, which was based on military archives of the Soviet Union which have been sealed for many years and revealed to the public for the first time.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Liu Yunlong, an actor well-known for his spy TV series, has made a breakthrough new work of art, acting as a “stuttering service agent” who is comical, which is soon to be broadcast.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In recent years, the popularity of TV series including Pretender, Mask, and Kite proves the great appeal of spy TV series.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Different from previous spy TV series, The Possibility of Victory takes a global view, extending its context to Far Eastern battlefield in the Soviet Union.</seg>
        <seg id="7">It is based in the final stage of the Resistance War against the Japanese invasion in 1944, and tells the story about Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), a secret agent of the Communist Party of China, who, led by Communist Party’s President of Linhe Province and Director of Far Eastern Information Bureau of Soviet Union, executes the Soviet Union’s “Mudanura” strategic plan.</seg>
        <seg id="8">In many spy TV series, the heroes are all impeccably handsome and mature super spies with superb IQ’s when they first appear on screen.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But in the opinion of Liu Yunlong, such people are not suitable to be spies, “Spies should be someone who won’t be recognized in the mass, and if he or she appears cool or handsome at first glance, he or she will attract nearly all the attention, so how can he or she hide in the enemy’s camp? There is a line in Kite, “If you hadn’t caught me, I would have nearly forgetten my identity as a member of Nationalist Party of China”, which shows how spies should not be presented as elites. ”</seg>
        <seg id="10">Therefore, in The Possibility of Victory, Liu Yunlong’s original idea was to design the hero Tang Fei as a comical “stuttering secret agent”.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The “enemy” camp in The Possibility of Victory, is led by the Japanese Fukuwara, played by Liang Guanhua, and Director of the Police Fang Shibao, played by Li Liqun.</seg>
        <seg id="12">These two skilled actors, one of whom comes from Northern China and the other from Southern China, invigorate multiple wonderful scenes in the TV series.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The director Yin Fei describes the performance of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong as “an acting battle”, “It was definitely a battle, they coordinated very well with each other, which was very moving for me. At many times, their performance was “improvised”, for instance, the script was only half a page, but without my disruption, they would continue their performance. ”</seg>
        <seg id="14">Masters don’t steal the show from others, and directors never disrupt a performance; all the actors were immersed in the characters, allowing them to not only craft the roles from the perspective of their characters, but also create more possibilities for the audience, and Yin Fei praised such performances as marvelous.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In the TV series, many familiar faces from “Liu’s spy TV series” can also be seen; for instance, three actors from the popular and influential “Mountain Town F4” in Kite have roles in The Possibility of Victory.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who play Song Xiao’an and Zhao Jianzhi respectively, serve as Tang Fei’s core assistants again.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Director Yin Fei said, “They don’t have any deep-rooted bad habits, they just followed the mainstream in that era, and that environment. ”</seg>
        <seg id="18">Liu Yunlong also said, “We should care about humanity.” This means that there must be good and bad people, and the villains are enemies, but they should be presented well, and the good guys should also be presented properly. ”</seg>
        <seg id="19">The endings of the two characters were also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believes that they will satisfy the audience.</seg>

        <seg id="2">《柳叶刀》杂志25日刊文表示，中国作为一个拥有14亿人口，规模与欧洲或美国相似的国家，现阶段新冠疫情得到有效控制，而没有再出现大范围传播的情况，在很大程度上控制住了国内的疫情。</seg>
        <seg id="3">文章表示，在近十多年时间里，中国对国内研究和公共卫生建设方面进行了大量的投资，这使得中国对新冠的准备比当年严重急性呼吸道综合征(SARS)的准备要充分得多。</seg>
        <seg id="4">作者表示，2002年SARS暴发时，起初中国准备不足，尤其是病原体无法确定。</seg>
        <seg id="5">当2019年12月发现新冠病毒时，中国科学家很快就能够鉴定出病毒种类，并于2020年1月11日与国际共享了基因组测序数据。</seg>
        <seg id="6">到1月底，来自中国大陆和香港的医生阐明了该病毒的临床特征，通过在《柳叶刀》上发表的研究论文，向世界警告了新冠病毒的威胁。</seg>
        <seg id="7">中国也一直处于疫苗研究的最前沿，在国家宣布紧急状态下，通过国内的紧密合作，这样的研究非常迅速而严格地展开，5月和7月，分别在《柳叶刀》上公布了中国开发的新冠疫苗早期试验取得进展的结果。</seg>
        <seg id="8">中国的经验表明，对国家卫生和研究体系进行投资，有效提高实验室能力是非常重要的。</seg>
        <seg id="9">这是国家对卫生紧急情况和全球卫生安全做出快速有效反应的基础。</seg>
        <seg id="10">其他国家，特别是低收入和中等收入国家来说，非常值得借鉴和学习。</seg>

        <seg id="2">The Lancet published an article on the 25th, saying that China, as a country with 1.4 billion population and the size similar to Europe or the U.S., has effectively contained COVID-19 outbreak at this stage, with no mass transmission again, and that it has the domestic pandemic under control to a great extent.</seg>
        <seg id="3">As the article mentioned, China’s large investment in domestic research and public health reinforcement over the past decade made China much more prepared for COVID-19 than it was for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).</seg>
        <seg id="4">The author wrote, when SARS broke out in 2002, China wasn’t prepared at the beginning, especially since it wasn’t able to identify the pathogen.</seg>
        <seg id="5">When coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists quickly identified the species of the virus and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="6">By the end of January, doctors from Mainland China and Hong Kong knew the clinical characteristics of the virus and published research papers in The Lancet to warn the world about the threat of the coronavirus.</seg>
        <seg id="7">China is also on the frontline of vaccine research, and when the national emergency state was announced, vaccine research was conducted swiftly and rigorously through close domestic collaborations; in May and July, early trial results of COVID-19 vaccines developed by China were published in The Lancet.</seg>
        <seg id="8">China’s experience shows the importance of investment in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capabilities.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It’s the foundation of a nation’s fast and effective response to health emergencies and global health safety issues.</seg>
        <seg id="10">It’s a lesson worth learning for other countries, especially low and middle income countries.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Aside from strong research capabilities, China’s experience proves that strong leadership is necessary to make right decisions based on science, and was key to the effective control of COVID-19.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The article underlines the fact that a government and its leaders must respect science and understand the value of science, so as to take actions most beneficial to society.</seg>
        <seg id="13">At the beginning of the outbreak, National Health Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate risks and transmission of the coronavirus, whose suggestions informed the decision to “lock down” Wuhan on January 23, and when some experts presented the necessity and urgency to build mobile cabin hospitals, the government quickly made the decision and implemented their advice while also seeking broad engagement with communities and the people, which contributed to the fast and effective control over the outbreak.</seg>
        <seg id="14">In the end, the article emphasizes, when facing global health emergencies, countries should strengthen global collaboration to jointly combat challenges.</seg>

        <seg id="3">大鹏导演的首部现实题材影片《吉祥如意》，成功入围本届上影节金爵奖，同时影片官方发布了首款海报。</seg>
        <seg id="4">海报 片方供图</seg>
        <seg id="5">影片《吉祥如意》是大鹏导演的第一部现实题材作品，也是他与金爵奖的二度结缘。</seg>
        <seg id="6">该片讲述了这样一个故事：一位喜剧片导演突发奇想，回到东北农村老家，希望将一家人如何过年拍成一部文艺电影，结果遭遇一系列意外。</seg>
        <seg id="7">因拍电影而聚齐的家庭成员们，完成了最后的聚会。</seg>
        <seg id="8">在今日发布的电影海报中，这个家庭中的一员 — — “三舅”王吉祥坐在画面中央抽着烟，背景是披上银装的东北黑土地，前景是中国人逢年过节必挂的红灯笼。</seg>
        <seg id="9">象征着喜庆、团圆的红灯笼与身影落寞的王吉祥形成了巨大反差，似乎也透露了这个大家庭关系中的复杂与纠结。</seg>

        <seg id="2">On July 18, 2020, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official nominated films for Golden Goblet Awards.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The first realistic film, The Reunions, directed by Da Peng, was nominated for the 23rd SIFF Golden Goblet Awards, and at the same time published its first poster.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Poster provided by producer</seg>
        <seg id="5">The Reunions is Da Peng’s first realistic film, and is his second brush with the Golden Goblet Awards.</seg>
        <seg id="6">It tells the story of a comedy director who has a sudden inspiration to return her hometown village in Northeast China and make an art movie about famiiy reunions during Spring Festival, but who encounters a series of accidents.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The family members finally together for the film and have their final reunion.</seg>
        <seg id="8">On the film poster published today, a member of the family, “Third Uncle” Wang Jixiang, sits in the center with a cigarette, and in the background is the black land of Northeast China covered by white snow, while the foreground is red lanterns hung for festivals.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The red lanterns symbolizing festivity and reunion contrast sharply with the lonely Wang Jixiang, and seem to show the complexity of large families.</seg>
        <seg id="10">According to reports, in the film, apart from the daughter of the “third uncle” Wang Jixiang, played by Liu Lu, all other characters were played by the directors’ family themselves, and this experimental audiovisual style breaks down the border between drama and reality, bringing about a brand new immersive experience for the audience.</seg>
        <seg id="11">According to Da Peng, inspiration came from “accidents”, a series of family accidents during production, which changed the original production plan; the use of real-life performances without scripts was finally recorded as a film, creating a film far different from what he originally imagined.</seg>
        <seg id="12">How did Da Peng face these “accidents”, and how did he embrace the changes brought about by the “accidents”?</seg>
        <seg id="13">There is no doubt that The Reunions is fully experimental: none of the cast are professionally trained, and the audiovisual style is quite creative, which transforms life into a movie, and composed of real-life videos, the audience will certainly find someone like themselves and their family, so that at the end of the film, it inspires deep thoughts.</seg>

        <seg id="2">In this place where the average temperature annually is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simply-decorated barracks stands at the pass, with a national flag flying in the wind not far from the barracks; soldiers here are on duty every day in the wind, while regularly patrolling to higher-altitude locations.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The soldiers climb up steep and rocky slopes on their hands and feet.</seg>
        <seg id="4">In late July, when lower altitudes are covered with flowers and leafy plants, only the ravine behind the barracks is relatively dense with greenery in Banong Zhuokang.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the post for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that it was their back garden, and that only in July and August every year can they see the grass growing slowly, and shortly afterwards it all turns yellow and is covered with snow.</seg>
        <seg id="6">A single foot patrol can take around nine hours.</seg>
        <seg id="7">In the tough plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are constantly in the company of snow-capped mountains and glaciers, and they need to patrol passes on foot at high altitudes regularly.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Now, a patrol team of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, takes to the patrol route once again.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Each soldier carries a weight of about 30 jin, and heads for the destination early in the morning.</seg>
        <seg id="10">On the way, one soldier suffers from altitude sickness and is helped by his partners.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In addition to patrol duty, soldiers at the Banong Zhuokang Sentinel Post also need to conduct tactical and physical training on a daily basis.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The oxygen level gets lower and lower as time passes and the altitude rises, and these factors test the will of patrol members whose physical strength has been constantly overexerted.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Yet they grit their teeth and persevered in crossing several landslides and challenging rapids.</seg>
        <seg id="14">At around 16:00, it was lunchtime for the patrol, and they sat down on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, regardless of rain and snow, to replenish their strength with solid food for lunch.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The soldiers at the Banong Zhuokang Sentinel Post need to conduct tactical and physical training on a daily basis.</seg>
        <seg id="16">During breaks, they play cards together, and the loser is required to do push-ups, which is both entertaining and good for body building.</seg>
        <seg id="17">After a short break in the cold wind, they climbed up to the destination of this patrol, and when they arrived, they took out the national flag on the mountain pass and swore a solemn oath.</seg>

        <seg id="5">我旧日所熟知的那个 优美环境与此刻雾霾笼罩的 天际线之间的对比， 在我心里翻涌不息。</seg>
        <seg id="6">我担心很有可能 曾经色彩多变的日落美景 将被阴暗的雾霾所吞噬。</seg>
        <seg id="7">在那一刻，我感到一阵强烈的冲动， 想要去做些什么， 但我并不知道该做些什么。</seg>
        <seg id="8">我所知道的只是 我不能就这样袖手旁观。</seg>
        <seg id="9">最大的挑战在于， 我并不了解环境科学。 空气质量管理， 或是大气化学。</seg>
        <seg id="10">我是一名电脑工程师， 而且我非常确定，我并不能 靠编码来解决大气污染问题。</seg>
        <seg id="11">（笑声） 我将以什么身份来解决这个问题？</seg>
        <seg id="12">我不过是个市井小民。</seg>
        <seg id="13">在接下来的几年里， 我学到了很重要的一课， 如果我们想要实现更好的未来， 我们都应该把这一课铭记在心。</seg>
        <seg id="14">即使你并非某一特殊领域的专家， 你的专业技能也可能蕴含了 解决那一领域问题的方法。</seg>
        <seg id="15">有时候，你所持有的独特视角 可以激发出非常规的 思维从而左右局势， 但你需要大胆去尝试。</seg>
        <seg id="16">唯有如此你才能够知晓结果。</seg>
        <seg id="17">当时我所知道的是， 如果我想要尝试去改变， 我必须先对污染有足够了解， 所以我又做回了一名学生。</seg>
        <seg id="18">我做了一些基础研究， 很快了解到大气污染 是世界上最大的环境健康风险。</seg>
        <seg id="19">世界卫生组织的数据显示 在2012年，全世界 几乎14%的死亡事件 都是由家庭及周边的 大气污染造成， 在中低端收入国家尤为常见。</seg>

        <seg id="22">在我的工作中， 我探寻着人工智能的 科技前沿成果， 包括人类和机器的共生关系， 找到有益的立足点 并帮我们做出更好的决定。</seg>
        <seg id="23">当我再想到大气污染问题时， 就如何治理大气污染这一问题， 事情变得明朗起来， 我们需要寻找更好的方法 做出更好的决定 考虑到问题很庞大， 协同合作是非常有必要的。</seg>
        <seg id="24">所以我决定去认识一些 在这一领域工作的人。</seg>
        <seg id="25">我开始与约翰内斯堡 以及其他周边城市的官员对话， 我也加入了本地的科学社区， 我还打了一些电话给 完全陌生却相关的人们。</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">One winter morning, a couple of years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed a haze hanging over the city.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I make that drive on most days, so it was unusual that I hadn't noticed this before.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Johannesburg is known for its distinctive skyline, which I could barely see that morning.</seg>
        <seg id="4">It didn't take long for me to realize that I was looking at an enormous cloud of air pollution.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The contrast between the scenic environment I knew and this smog-covered skyline stirred up something within me.</seg>
        <seg id="6">I was appalled by the possibility of this city of bright and vivid sunsets being overrun by a dull haze.</seg>
        <seg id="7">At that moment, I felt an urge to do something about it, but I didn't know what.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All I knew was I couldn't just stand idly by.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The main challenge was, I didn't know much about environmental science air-quality management or atmospheric chemistry.</seg>
        <seg id="10">I am a computer engineer, and I was pretty sure I couldn't code my way out of this air pollution problem.</seg>
        <seg id="11">(Laughter) Who was I to do anything about this issue?</seg>
        <seg id="12">I was but a citizen.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In the following years, I learned a very important lesson, a lesson we all need to take to heart if we are to work towards a better future.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Even if you're not an expert in a particular domain, your outside expertise may hold the key to solving big problems within that domain.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Sometimes the unique perspective you have can result in unconventional thinking that can move the needle, but you need to be bold enough to try.</seg>
        <seg id="16">That's the only way you'll ever know.</seg>
        <seg id="17">What I knew back then was that if I was even going to try to make a difference, I had to get smart about air pollution first, and so I became a student again.</seg>
        <seg id="18">I did a bit of basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the world's biggest environmental health risk.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Data from the World Health Organization shows that almost 14 percent of all deaths worldwide in 2012 were attributable to household and ambient air pollution, with most occurring in low- and middle-income countries.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Ambient air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria and HIV/AIDS.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In Africa, premature deaths from unsafe sanitation or childhood malnutrition pale in comparison to deaths due to air pollution, and it comes at a huge economic cost: over 400 billion US dollars as of 2013, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Now, in my work, I explore new frontiers for artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine can find a beneficial footing and help us to make better decisions.</seg>
        <seg id="23">As I thought about the air pollution problem, it became clear that we needed to find a way to make better decisions about how we manage air pollution, and given the scale of the problem, it was necessary to do it in a collaborative way.</seg>
        <seg id="24">So I decided I'd better get to know some people working within the field.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I started to speak to officials from the City of Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I engaged the local scientific community, and I also made a few cold calls.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The process of engagement I embarked upon helped me to develop a deeper understanding of the problem.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It also helped me to avoid the trap people in my profession sometimes fall into when trying to innovate, where we are quick to apply a technology before we've firmly grasped the problem at hand.</seg>
        <seg id="28">I began to develop an idea about what I could do to improve the situation.</seg>
        <seg id="29">I started by simply asking myself how I could bring together in some meaningful way my skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the expertise of the people I'd reached out to.</seg>
        <seg id="30">I wanted to create an online air-quality management platform that would uncover trends in pollution and project into the future to determine what outcomes can be expected.</seg>
        <seg id="31">I was determined to see my idea translate into a practical solution, but I faced uncertainty and had no guarantee of success.</seg>
        <seg id="32">What I had was a very particular set of engineering skills, skills I'd acquired over my career (Laughter) that were new to people who had been working on the air pollution problem for so many years.</seg>
        <seg id="33">What I have come to realize is that sometimes just one fresh perspective, one new skill set, can make the conditions right for something remarkable to happen.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Our willpower and imagination are a guiding light, enabling us to chart new paths and navigate through obstacles.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Armed with a firmer understanding of the air pollution problem, and having managed to source over a decade's worth of data on air pollutant levels and the meteorological conditions for in and around Johannesburg, my colleagues from South Africa and China and myself created an air-quality decision support system that lives in the cloud.</seg>
        <seg id="36">This software system analyzes historical and real-time data to uncover the spatial-temporal trends in pollution.</seg>
        <seg id="37">We then used new machine learning technology to predict future levels of pollution for several different pollutants days in advance.</seg>
        <seg id="38">This means that citizens can make better decisions about their daily movements and about where to settle their families.</seg>
        <seg id="39">We can predict adverse pollution events ahead of time, identify heavy polluters, and they can be ordered by the relevant authorities to scale back their operations.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Through assisted scenario planning, city planners can also make better decisions about how to extend infrastructure, such as human settlements or industrial zones.</seg>
        <seg id="41">We completed a pilot of our technology that was run over a period of 120 days, covering all of South Africa.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Our results were confirmed when we demonstrated a tight correlation between the forecasting data and the data we were getting on the ground.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Through our leadership, we have brought cutting-edge, world-leading assets that can perform air-quality forecasting at an unprecedented resolution and accuracy, benefiting the city that I drove into one winter morning not very long ago, and thought to myself, "Something is wrong here. I wonder what can be done?"</seg>
        <seg id="44">So here is the point: What if I'd not investigated the problem of air pollution further?</seg>
        <seg id="45">What if I'd not shown some concern for the state of the environment and just hoped that someone, somewhere, was taking care of the matter?</seg>
        <seg id="46">What I have learned is that, when embarking on a challenging endeavor that advances a cause that we firmly believe in, it is important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequence of not acting.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We should not get distracted by resistance and opposition, but this should motivate us further.</seg>
        <seg id="48">So wherever you are in the world, the next time you find that there's some natural curiosity you have that is being piqued, and it's about something you care about, and you have some crazy or bold ideas, and perhaps it's outside the realm of your expertise, ask yourself this: Why not?</seg>
        <seg id="49">Why not just go ahead and tackle the problem as best as you can, in your own way?</seg>
        <seg id="50">You may be pleasantly surprised.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Thank you.</seg>
        <seg id="52">(Applause)</seg>

        <seg id="1">很多人认为开车是一件 仅仅那些能看见的人才能做的事情。</seg>
        <seg id="2">盲人想单独的安全的驾驶一辆车 直到现在，也被认为是一件不可能的任务。</seg>
        <seg id="3">大家好，我叫丹尼斯·洪， 我们为了盲人的自由和独立 制造了一辆针对视觉障碍有问题的人们而设计的汽车。</seg>
        <seg id="4">在我讲述这辆盲人用的车之前， 让我简略的说一下我曾经做过的另外一个项目 叫做美国国防部高级研究计划局城市挑战赛。</seg>
        <seg id="5">这是关于制造一辆能自己驾驶的 机械车。</seg>
        <seg id="6">你按下开始键，不再碰任何东西， 它也能完全自动的到达它的目的地。</seg>
        <seg id="7">在2007年的挑战赛上，我们团队赢得了50万美元 获得比赛的第三名。</seg>
        <seg id="8">大概那个时候， 全国盲人协会，或盲协， 对设计团队提出了挑战 关于谁能设计出一辆 能让盲人独立安全驾驶的汽车。</seg>
        <seg id="9">我们觉得要尝试一下， 因为我们觉得，哎，这个会难到哪里去呢。</seg>
        <seg id="10">我们已经有了辆自动的汽车。</seg>
        <seg id="11">我们只要让盲人做到里面开车，那不就完事啦，对吧？</seg>
        <seg id="12">（笑声） 但是我们错的不靠谱了。</seg>
        <seg id="13">盲协想要的 不是一辆能载着盲人乱逛的车， 而是一辆盲人能主动做出选择并驾驭的一辆车。</seg>
        <seg id="14">所以我们不得不放弃我们原有的所有东西 从头开始做起。</seg>
        <seg id="15">为了测试这个疯狂的想法， 我们设计出了一个小型沙地车的原型车 来测试其可行性。</seg>
        <seg id="16">在2009年暑期， 我们邀请了全国很多盲人青年 并给他们次机会用这车来兜风。</seg>
        <seg id="17">这绝对是一个炫酷的体验。</seg>
        <seg id="18">但是这车的问题在于 它的设计只能让盲人在很有限的环境下驾驶， 像一个封闭的停车场-- 甚至能在用红色交通锥搭成的小路上行驶。</seg>
        <seg id="19">所以有了这次成功， 我们决定进行重要的下一步， 制造一辆能在真正马路上行驶的真正的车。</seg>
        <seg id="20">那它怎么运作的呢？</seg>
        <seg id="21">嗯，这是个相对复杂的系统， 但是让我来解释一下，来简化一下。</seg>
        <seg id="22">我们有三个阶段。</seg>
        <seg id="23">我们有感应阶段，计算阶段 和非视觉界面。</seg>
        <seg id="24">驾驶员明显是看不见的， 所以系统必须能感知周围环境 并为驾驶员收集数据。</seg>
        <seg id="25">这点，我们使用初始计量元件。</seg>
        <seg id="26">它测量加速度，角加速度-- 就像人耳，内耳。</seg>
        <seg id="27">我把这信息和全球定位系统结合在一起 来预测车辆所处的位置。</seg>
        <seg id="28">我们还用两个摄像头来探测行车的路径。</seg>
        <seg id="29">我们还用三个激光测距仪。</seg>
        <seg id="30">激光扫描环境来探测障碍物-- 从前方，后方靠经的车辆 同时还有闯进路上的任何障碍物， 在车辆周围的任何障碍物。</seg>
        <seg id="31">所有海量的信息接着汇总到电脑中， 电脑会做两件事。</seg>
        <seg id="32">首先的，一件事是处理信息 来了解周围环境-- 哪些是行车路径，哪些是障碍物-- 并转化这些信息给驾驶者。</seg>
        <seg id="33">这系统也是十分智能化 能算出最安全的行车路径。</seg>
        <seg id="34">我们也能发出指令 关于如何操作车辆的运行程序。</seg>
        <seg id="35">但是问题是：我们怎么才能把 信息和指令 够快又够准确地传输 给盲人来确保他能驾驶？</seg>
        <seg id="36">为此，我们设计了很多种不同的 非视觉用户界面技术。</seg>
        <seg id="37">最初的三维平音响系统， 震动背心， 声控齿轮，腿带， 甚至给脚施压的鞋子。</seg>
        <seg id="38">但是今天我们讲的是关于 其中三样非视觉用户界面技术。</seg>
        <seg id="39">第一个界面叫做驾驶手柄。</seg>
        <seg id="40">这是一对手套， 在指节部它有震动元件， 以此你能传输如何行驶的指令-- 方向和幅度。</seg>
        <seg id="41">另外一个设备叫做速度震带。</seg>
        <seg id="42">这个车椅--实际上，这是个按摩椅。</seg>
        <seg id="43">我们把它拆出来，我们重组不同模式的震动元件。 我们让它们来传输速度的信息， 同时也有如何使用油门和刹车的指示。</seg>
        <seg id="44">在这里，你能看到 电脑如何理解周围环境。 因为你无法看出震动， 我们实际在驾驶员身上安装了红色发光二极管，所以他能看到什么正在发生。</seg>
        <seg id="45">这是感应的数据， 这数据从感应器被传输到电脑里。</seg>
        <seg id="46">所以这两种设备，驾驶手柄和速度震带， 是很有效的。</seg>
        <seg id="47">但是问题是 这些是指令暗示装置。</seg>
        <seg id="48">所以这不是真正意义上的自由，对吧？</seg>
        <seg id="49">电脑告诉你如何驾驶-- 左转，右转，加速，刹车。</seg>
        <seg id="50">我把这叫做副驾驶问题。</seg>
        <seg id="51">所以我们正避免指令暗示装置， 并更关注于 信息装置。</seg>
        <seg id="52">这种非视觉信息界面的一个典型例子是 叫做空图。</seg>
        <seg id="53">把这个看成盲人的显示器。</seg>
        <seg id="54">这是个小桌面，有很多孔在上面， 压缩空气从中排除， 以此它就能描述成图片。</seg>
        <seg id="55">所以即使你是盲人，你把手放在它上面， 你也能感应到行径路线和障碍物。</seg>
        <seg id="56">实际上，你还能改变空气中释放出的频率 有可能还有温度。</seg>
        <seg id="57">这实际就是一个多维的用户界面。</seg>
        <seg id="58">这里，你能看到左，右两边的摄像头 以及电脑如何解析并传送这些信息给空图。</seg>
        <seg id="59">就这样，我们正展示一个模拟程序， 一个盲人正在用空图驾驶。</seg>
        <seg id="60">这个程序在依据不同种类的非视觉用户界面方面对于训练盲人驾驶者 和快速地测试不同的理论 有很大的帮助。</seg>
        <seg id="61">这就是基本上它如何运作的。</seg>
        <seg id="62">但是这车是一个模型车， 它也不会上路 除非它被证明和如今的汽车一样驾驶安全，或者更安全而言。</seg>
        <seg id="63">我真地坚信这会发生。</seg>
        <seg id="64">但是，社会是否， 它们是否能接受这个激进的想法呢？</seg>
        <seg id="65">我们将如何来处理保险呢？</seg>
        <seg id="66">我们将如何签发驾照呢？</seg>
        <seg id="67">在技术挑战的背后还有很多各种不同的障碍 在其真正成为现实前我们需要去解决。</seg>
        <seg id="68">当然，这个项目的主要目的 是设计一辆盲人驾驶的车。</seg>
        <seg id="69">但是潜在的比这更重要的 是这个项目中的副产品中 蕴含的巨大价值。</seg>
        <seg id="70">能用来透视黑暗，雨雾的 传感器。</seg>

        <seg id="1">Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see.</seg>
        <seg id="2">A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task, until now.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired.</seg>
        <seg id="4">So before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself.</seg>
        <seg id="6">You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination fully autonomously.</seg>
        <seg id="7">So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition.</seg>
        <seg id="8">So about that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.</seg>
        <seg id="9">We decided to give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"</seg>
        <seg id="10">We have already an autonomous vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="11">We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?</seg>
        <seg id="12">(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.</seg>
        <seg id="13">What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch.</seg>
        <seg id="15">So to test this crazy idea, we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.</seg>
        <seg id="17">It was an absolutely amazing experience.</seg>
        <seg id="18">But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment, in a flat, closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.</seg>
        <seg id="19">So with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.</seg>
        <seg id="20">So how does it work?</seg>
        <seg id="21">Well, it's a rather complex system, but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.</seg>
        <seg id="22">So we have three steps.</seg>
        <seg id="23">We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Now obviously the driver cannot see, so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="25">For that, we use an initial measurement unit.</seg>
        <seg id="26">So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like a human ear, inner ear.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car.</seg>
        <seg id="28">We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.</seg>
        <seg id="29">And we also use three laser range finders.</seg>
        <seg id="30">The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front, the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads, any obstacles around the vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="31">So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.</seg>
        <seg id="32">One is, first of all, process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles -- and convey this information to the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car.</seg>
        <seg id="34">So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the problem is this: How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?</seg>
        <seg id="36">So for this, we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology.</seg>
        <seg id="37">So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip, even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.</seg>
        <seg id="38">But today we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.</seg>
        <seg id="40">So these are a pair of gloves, and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer -- the direction and the intensity.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Another device is called SpeedStrip.</seg>
        <seg id="42">So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.</seg>
        <seg id="43">We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns, and we actuate them to convey information about the speed, and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.</seg>
        <seg id="44">So over here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, and because you cannot see the vibration, we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.</seg>
        <seg id="45">This is the sensory data, and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.</seg>
        <seg id="46">So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip, are very effective.</seg>
        <seg id="47">But the problem is these are instructional cue devices.</seg>
        <seg id="48">So this is not really freedom, right?</seg>
        <seg id="49">The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, stop.</seg>
        <seg id="50">We call this the "backseat-driver problem."</seg>
        <seg id="51">So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices, and we're now focusing more on the informational devices.</seg>
        <seg id="52">A good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="53">So think of it as a monitor for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="54">So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it, and compressed air comes out, so it can actually draw images.</seg>
        <seg id="55">So even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it, you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Actually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="57">So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="59">For this, we're showing a simulator, a blind person driving using the AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="61">So basically that's how it works.</seg>
        <seg id="62">But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle, and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And I truly believe that this can happen.</seg>
        <seg id="64">But still, will the society, would they accept such a radical idea?</seg>
        <seg id="65">How are we going to handle insurance?</seg>
        <seg id="66">How are we going to issue driver's licenses?</seg>
        <seg id="67">There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project.</seg>
        <seg id="70">The sensors that are used can see through the dark, the fog and rain.</seg>
        <seg id="71">And together with this new type of interfaces, we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Or for the blind, everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting, in the office setting.</seg>
        <seg id="73">Just imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and read using these non-visual interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="74">This is priceless.</seg>
        <seg id="75">So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Thank you very much.</seg>

        <seg id="2">近日，带着中国电影人对抗疫英雄的敬意，博纳影业集团董事长于冬、导演刘伟强(图左）在广州与钟南山院士，就抗疫题材影片《中国医生》的拍摄制作工作进行了座谈交流。</seg>
        <seg id="3">博纳影业希望能借由《中国医生》，向所有战斗在疫情防控一线的医护、防疫工作者致敬！</seg>
        <seg id="4">2021年，该片将作为庆祝中国共产党建党100周年献礼影片全国公映。</seg>
        <seg id="5">目前，博纳影业正在中宣部和国家电影局的安排部署下，广东省电影局及湖北省电影局的支持下，组织电影《中国机长》原班人马筹拍电影《中国医生》，这是一部反映在党中央的坚强领导下，全国人民团结一心抗击新冠肺炎疫情的影片。</seg>
        <seg id="6">影片聚焦武汉抗疫一线，将以武汉医护人员及各省市援鄂医疗队为人物背景，从人性的角度，运用独特的叙事，以及极具冲击力的镜头语言，全景展现抗疫一线充满奉献和牺牲精神的中国医护人员的感人故事。</seg>
        <seg id="7">据了解，武汉解封之日的第一时间，博纳公司便克服重重困难，派出采拍小组深入疫情一线，与数百位医护工作者面对面交流了解、搜集资料，目前已经采访到了包括钟南山院士本人、广州驰援武汉第一人、广东援鄂医疗队，以及武汉金银潭医院、武汉协和医院、武汉大学中南医院、武汉中心医院等抗疫战线最前沿的白衣天使们，拍下了大量珍贵的第一手视频资料。</seg>
        <seg id="8">钟南山院士在此次座谈会中亦对电影的拍摄提出了期待和希望：“ 我很期待，希望你们不仅要走访一些抛头露面比较多的专家，还要更多地采访在一线埋头苦干的医务人员，他们是大多数。”</seg>
        <seg id="9">他表示，他之前看过《我和我的祖国》《中国机长》，认为以普通人视角讲述大格局故事的方法就很好。</seg>
        <seg id="10">“现在一些国外朋友对中国还是有一些误解。”</seg>
        <seg id="11">在谈到影片的传播时，钟南山院士表示，目前国外有些人喜欢将病毒贴上政治化标签，他希望电影能从人性的角度打动观众：“ 这部电影除了在中国放映以外，最好也能在国外放映，要用国内外观众都能理解的方式，用真正的人文精神打动观众。”</seg>
        <seg id="12">钟南山院士还深情回忆了上世纪80年代的影片《人到中年》，“这么多年过去了，我对改革开放后电影印象最深的还是《人到中年》，当时我国外的医生朋友们都看哭了，如果《中国医生》能够起到这样的作用，那就很了不起了。”</seg>
        <seg id="13">钟南山院士表示，如果《中国医生》能引起国外观众的共鸣，那就非常成功。</seg>
        <seg id="14">在座谈交流时，钟南山院士还分享了对当前国际疫情防控的意见和建议，“ 我相信人永远比病毒聪明。”</seg>
        <seg id="15">钟南山院士表示，虽说病毒难以预测，但从原始社会至今，人类已渡过了千难万险，如今现代社会有发达的医疗科技和社会管理措施，再加上全世界的医务人员、甚至老百姓都对科学应对新冠肺炎疫情有了基本认识，人们不会再像以前那么被动，“接下来要注意两个方面的工作，一是要研究全世界怎么加强合作，二是注重对人们心灵的抚慰” 。</seg>

        <seg id="1">“Chinese Doctors” pays tribute in film to heroes of the fight against the epidemic - Xinhuanet</seg>
        <seg id="2">Recently, representing the respects of Chinese filmmakers for the heroes of the fight against the epidemic, Bona Pictures board chairman Yu Dong and film director Liu Weiqiang (left in image) held a discussion and exchange symposium with academician Zhong Nanshan on the filming and production work for “Chinese Doctors”, a film about the fight against the epidemic.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Bona Pictures hopes, through “Chinese Doctors”, to pay tribute to all medical staff and epidemic control workers fighting on the front line in the fight against the epidemic!</seg>
        <seg id="4">In 2021, the film will be showed nationwide as part of the celebrations surrounding the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Currently, under the arrangement and direction of the Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the China Film Administration, and with the support of the Guangdong Province Film Administration and Hubei Province Film Administration, Bona Pictures is organizing the original crew of “The Captain” to film “Chinese Doctors”, a film that will reflect the unified effort of the whole nation to fight the COVID-19 epidemic under the firm leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The film will focus on the front line of the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, feature Wuhan medical personnel and the medical aid teams from the various provinces as characters, and from the perspective of different personalities, use unique narratives and highly impactful cinematic language to provide a panoramic view of the moving story of the deep spirit of dedication and sacrifice among China’s medical personnel in the fight against the epidemic.</seg>
        <seg id="7">It is reported that from the first moment of the day Wuhan was placed under lockdown, Bona Pictures overcame numerous obstacles to dispatch filming teams to the front lines of the fight against the epidemic, where they conducted face-to-face exchanges and footage collection with hundreds of medical workers, as well as interviews with Zhong Nanshan, the first rescue worker to arrive in Wuhan from Guangzhou, the medical aid team dispatched to Hubei from Guangdong, and the angels in white lab coats who formed the vanguard of the battle against the epidemic from institutions including Wuhan Jinyitan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, and the Central Hospital of Wuhan, ultimately obtaining large amounts of precious first-hand footage.</seg>
        <seg id="8">At the symposium, academician Zhong Nanshan also expressed his hopes and expectations for the film, “I look forward to it, and I hope that while you feature some of the more publicly known experts, the majority of your interviews should focus on the medical workers who worked so diligently on the front lines. “</seg>
        <seg id="9">He stated that he had previously seen “My People, My Country” and “The Captain”, and thought that telling the larger story from the perspective of ordinary people was a good technique.</seg>
        <seg id="10">“Some of our foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China. “</seg>
        <seg id="11">Discussing the film’s distribution, academician Zhong Nanshan said that currently, some people in foreign countries say the virus is a politicized topic, so he hopes the humanity of the film’s perspective will move the audience, “Beyond just being screened in China, it’s best if the film can also be screened abroad, so the film should be shot in a manner that allows both foreign and domestic audiences to understand and genuinely be moved. “</seg>
        <seg id="12">He fondly recalls the 1980’s film “At Middle Age”, saying, “After so many years, the opening up and reform-era film that made the deepest impression on me is still ‘At Middle Age’, which moved my foreign doctor friends to tears, so it would be wonderful if ‘Chinese Doctors’ could have the same effect. “</seg>
        <seg id="13">Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if “Chinese Doctors” resonates with foreign audiences, it will be a great success.</seg>
        <seg id="14">He also shared his opinions and advice on China’s current epidemic control work, saying, “I’m sure people will always be smarter than viruses. “</seg>
        <seg id="15">Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is unpredictable, since primal times, humanity has overcome countless dangers, and with the advanced medical technology and social management measures we have in modern times, as well as the help of the global medical community and the universal basic awareness of scientific measures for combatting COVID-19 among the general population, humanity will no longer be as helpless as before, “There are two things we have to focus on, the first being how to strengthen global cooperation, and the second how to provide emotional comfort and support for people.</seg>

        <seg id="2">中新网7月26日电 据最高检网站消息，今年上半年，全国检察机关共起诉诈骗犯罪58101人，同比上升35%。</seg>
        <seg id="3">特别是妨害疫情防控犯罪中，诈骗犯罪多发，检察机关起诉诈骗犯罪人数占全部妨害疫情防控犯罪人数的43.4%。</seg>
        <seg id="4">最高人民检察院有针对性地开展指导，目前已发布的十批涉疫情防控典型案例中，涉及诈骗罪的共9起。</seg>
        <seg id="5">从上半年检察机关办案情况看，涉及诈骗犯罪的名目繁多，上至国家宏观政策，下至老百姓衣食住行，包括涉疫情诈骗、“医托”诈骗、“保健品”诈骗、“招生中介”诈骗、“套路贷”诈骗、骗取国家补贴诈骗、民族资产解冻诈骗等等，不断“推陈出新”，范围涉及教育、医疗、就业、养老、社保、征地拆迁、精准扶贫、金融信贷等多个领域，不仅给被害人造成经济损失，也严重影响经济社会发展。</seg>
        <seg id="6">特别是一些电信网络诈骗突破国界、地域和人员的限制，具有涉众、跨境、远程、电子支付等特征，不特定受害群体多，危害大。</seg>
        <seg id="7">如，有的成立专门公司，租用高档写字楼，设立多个部门或岗位，利用合法的网络平台宣传、招聘，对招聘人员进行培训和考核，采用企业运作模式管理，披着“合法外衣”，迷惑性更强。</seg>
        <seg id="8">依法惩治和防范犯罪，及时向社会公众和有关部门发出预警，是检察机关义不容辞的责任。</seg>
        <seg id="9">在司法办案中，检察机关认真履行职责，既坚持对诈骗犯罪保持高压态势，又有针对性地细化各项执法举措，通过制发检察建议等促进社会治理。</seg>
        <seg id="10">检察机关严把批捕、起诉诈骗案件事实关、证据关、程序关和法律适用关，以事实为根据，以法律为准绳，做到不枉不纵。</seg>
        <seg id="11">特别是对于电信网络诈骗犯罪，注重电子数据在事实认定中的核心作用，努力构建电子数据、言词证据、书证之间相互印证的证据链条。</seg>
        <seg id="12">如浙江省宁波市鄞州区检察院办理的应某涉疫诈骗案，检察机关第一时间提前介入，从案件发生到办结，仅用5天时间，体现了从快从严办理、维护社会大局稳定的态度和决心。</seg>
        <seg id="13">在审查逮捕和审查起诉环节，注重案件的漏犯追诉工作，纠正公安机关漏捕733人，纠正公安机关遗漏审查起诉同案犯1113人。</seg>
        <seg id="14">上半年，全国检察机关针对诈骗犯罪发出检察建议298件，促进携手共同防范诈骗犯罪，推动深层次治理。</seg>
        <seg id="15">如，针对办案中发现的通信企业、银行、中介组织等在电信网络监管中存在的漏洞，广东省广州市检察院、东莞市检察院及时提出检察建议，敦促有关单位强化监管、完善机制，助推长效制度建设。</seg>
        <seg id="16">四是全力做好追赃挽损工作。</seg>
        <seg id="17">各地检察机关抓住介入侦查引导取证、审查起诉等重要环节，督促侦查机关积极追缴赃款，配合有关部门做好追赃挽损工作，努力将诈骗犯罪给人民群众造成的经济损失降至最低。</seg>
        <seg id="18">如北京市检察院办理的林某某套路贷案件，该案涉及22套房产轮候查封，在房产可能被其他案件先行处置的情况下，首创制发《暂缓执行函》， 及时送达相关法院，建议先前查封法院对涉案房产暂缓执行，待犯罪事实查明后统一处置，为追回涉案房产、挽回被害人损失作出最大努力。</seg>
        <seg id="19">检察官提醒大家，对诈骗犯罪要有很高的警惕，不要指望“天上掉馅饼”，也不要以为便宜就轻信，守好自己的“钱袋子”。</seg>

        <seg id="1">Telecommunication fraud crimes increase by 70% in the first half of the year, the Supreme People's Procuratorate summarizes features - China News</seg>
        <seg id="2">July 26 (China News) According to the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, the procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted a total of 58,101 people for fraud crimes, a year-on-year increase of 35%.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Especially among crimes obstructing the pandemic prevention and control, there are many fraudulent crimes, accounting for 43.4% of the total number of crimes obstructing pandemic prevention and control.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The Supreme People's Procuratorate has provided targeted guidance and has now released ten batches of typical cases involving pandemic prevention and control, including a total of 9 cases of fraudulent crime.</seg>
        <seg id="5">From the cases handled by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, a wide range of fraudulent crimes are involved, ranging from national macro policies to people's basic necessities of life: typical cases include pandemic-related fraud, "hospital scalping”, "health care products", "enrollment agencies", "loan fraud", defrauding people of state subsidies, fraud regarding unfreezing national assets, and so on, but the new emerges out of the old constantly, and fraud involving education, medical care, employment, pensions, social security, land acquisition and relocation, targeted poverty alleviation, financial credit, and other areas has emerged, which has not only caused economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affected economic and social development.</seg>
        <seg id="6">In particular, some telecommunication fraud even crosses national boundaries or geographical and personnel restrictions, which involves victims without specific features and cause harm through cross-border, remote, and electronic payment.</seg>
        <seg id="7">For example, some set up companies in rented high-grade office buildings, providing multiple departments or positions that use legitimate online platforms for promotion, and which recruits, trains, and assesses its employees; management models of enterprise operation, cloaked in "legality", makes it even more confusing.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It is the compelling duty of the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crime in accordance with the law, and to issue timely warnings to the public and relevant authorities.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In the judicial handling of cases, the procuratorial organs have conscientiously discharged their duties, maintained a high-handed attitude towards fraudulent crimes, and refined various law enforcement initiatives in a targeted manner to promote social governance by formulating and issuing procuratorial recommendations.</seg>
        <seg id="10">It is required for the procuratorial organs to strictly adhere to the facts, evidence, procedures, and application of the law in arresting and prosecuting swindlers; facts should be used as the basis and the law should be used as the criterion to ensure that no law is broken and no crimes can escape legal sanction.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In particular, for telecommunications fraud crimes, the central role of electronic data in the determination of facts is emphasized, and efforts should be made to build a chain of evidence that corroborates electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.</seg>
        <seg id="12">For example, in pandemic-related fraud crime cases accepted by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organ intervened in advance and the whole process from the case occurrence to the conclusion only took five days, reflecting the attitude and determination to deal with the case quickly and strictly, and to maintain social stability.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In the review of arrests and prosecution, emphasis is placed on the prosecution of loophole crimes; until now, 733 people who were omitted from arrest and 1,113 accomplices who failed to be prosecuted previously by the public security have been taken in.</seg>
        <seg id="14">In the first half of the year, the procuratorial organs in China issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes to jointly prevent fraud crimes and promote deep-rooted governance.</seg>
        <seg id="15">For example, in response to the loopholes found in the telecommunications network supervision of communications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations during the handling of cases as well as the Guangzhou Procuratorate and Dongguan Procuratorate in Guangdong Province made timely procuratorial recommendations that urged the relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and help promote the construction of a long-term system.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Efforts were made to make criminals give up their takings and retrieve losses.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Procuratorial organs everywhere seized the opportunity to intervene in important links such as investigation, guided obtainment of evidence, review and prosecution, and urged the investigative organizations to actively recover illicit money together with relevant departments, meaning these departments can do a good job in recovering the illicit money and retrieving losses, and can strive to minimize the economic losses caused to the victims of fraudulent crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="18">For example, the People’s Procuratorate of Beijing Municipality handled a loan crime case involving Lin, which involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed, and in the event that the properties might be disposed of by other cases beforehand, the first "Letter of Execution Suspension" was issued and sent to the relevant court in time, suggesting that the previous court executing the sealing order should put a hold on the handling of the properties involved, which will be disposed in a unified manner after the facts of the crime are ascertained, suggesting that all efforts have been made to recover the properties and retrieve the losses of the victims.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The prosecutor reminded to the public to be very alert regarding fraud crimes, to not expect "windfalls", to not readily believe others because the product is cheap, and to guard their own "wallets".</seg>

        <seg id="2">2020-07-26 11:42:58 来源：中国经济网 作者：朱延静 责任编辑：朱延静</seg>
        <seg id="3">酷暑炎炎，经济日报-中国经济网记者走进贵州省威宁县迤那镇中海村。</seg>
        <seg id="4">顶着烈日，村民李元忠在基地里锄草，虽然脸上晒得通红，但嘴里时不时地哼唱几句小曲。</seg>
        <seg id="5">迤那镇所在的威宁县，因纬度低、海拔高，光照充足、昼夜温差大，所产苹果含糖量高、口感好，在周边地区具有一定知名度，但也因为个头小、斑点多，一直没能卖出个好价钱，没能形成产业规模。</seg>
        <seg id="6">迤那镇曾是个“包谷洋芋度春秋”的贫困乡镇，10年前当地贫困发生率高达25.8%。</seg>
        <seg id="7">在脱贫攻坚进入决战决胜的关键时期，改变传统种植习惯、调整产业结构，增加农民收入迫在眉睫。</seg>
        <seg id="8">迤那镇党委书记陈超和镇里一班人经过多次走访后认为，产业发展不能再走老路。</seg>
        <seg id="9">为此，迤那镇引进龙头企业、以现代化方式种植苹果。</seg>
        <seg id="10">威宁超越农业有限公司副总经理侯建文2015年从陕西来到迤那镇调研，一眼就看中了当地的种植条件，从2016年开始到当地栽种苹果树。</seg>
        <seg id="11">起初，村里动员李元忠将土地流转出来栽种苹果树，李元忠夫妇俩心里犯起了嘀咕：“种了那么多年苹果，也没看到村里谁种苹果发了财。”</seg>
        <seg id="12">“所种苹果都是矮化苹果，不会让苹果树长得太高。”</seg>
        <seg id="13">让李元忠没想到的是，这次苹果种植采用了新方法，灌溉水管铺到每颗苹果树下，水和肥料一起浇到树根，秋天收果子时，拖拉机直接开进果园，站着就能摘果子。</seg>
        <seg id="14">目前，苹果基地已逐步进入丰产期，市场也正如侯建文所预想的那样，苹果并不愁卖，深受北京、上海、广州等城市消费者喜爱。</seg>
        <seg id="15">日益壮大的苹果产业，让李元忠的生活有了新变化，虽然还在种地，但收入有了新来源。</seg>
        <seg id="16">李元忠家有9亩多土地流转给了苹果基地，每年除了保底的土地流转费外，挂果后还有利润分红，夫妻俩平常在基地里务工，“一人每天可得80元，常年有活干”。</seg>
        <seg id="17">李元忠告诉记者，去年利润分红得了2800多元，加上土地流转费以及夫妻俩的务工收入，一家收入8万多元，“吃穿不愁了，小康的日子已经过上了”。</seg>
        <seg id="18">“目前已经初见成效，1亩苹果的年产值超过1.5万元，大约是种玉米的10倍。”</seg>
        <seg id="19">陈超告诉记者，迤那全镇目前栽种了2万亩苹果，仅在中海村就有6000亩，覆盖农户4056户、1.72万人，其中覆盖建档立卡贫困户656户、2952人，一年发放工资就超过600万元，真正实现了基地建在家门口，打工不用往外走。</seg>
        <seg id="20">腰包日渐鼓起来的李元忠也开始实现自己的“心愿”。</seg>
        <seg id="21">今年农历春节，李元忠买了一辆越野车，如今天天开着汽车上下班，“家里还有十几亩土地，等下一步苹果基地拓展规模，全部流转给他们，收入就更多了。”</seg>

        <seg id="2">2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: www.ce.cn Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing</seg>
        <seg id="3">In the summer heat, reporters from Economic Daily-ce.cn visited Zhonghai Village in Yina Township, Weining County, Guizhou Province.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Under the blazing sun, villager Li Yuanzhong hoed in the field, and though his face burning red, he was humming a happy tune.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Thanks to its low latitude, high altitude, abundant sunlight and big day-night temperature differences, the apples produced in Weining County have high sugar content and great taste, which have given them a certain notoriety in certain areas, yet the apples don’t sell for a good price because they are small in size and spotty, which is hwy they haven’t moved beyond this region.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Yina Township used to suffer from poverty, “getting through the year with corn and potatoes”, and 10 years ago, the local poverty rate was 25.8%.</seg>
        <seg id="7">At this critical period of poverty alleviation, it is high time to change traditional growing practices and adjust the industrial structure to increase income for farmers.</seg>
        <seg id="8">After multiple visits and interviews, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party committee of Yina Township, along with the township team believe industry development can’t follow the old path.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Therefore, Yina Township brought in leading enterprises to grow apples in a modernized way.</seg>
        <seg id="10">In 2015, Hou Jianwen, Vice GM of Weining Chaoyue Agricultural Co. Ltd, came to survey Yina Township from Shaanxi and liked the local growing conditions instantly, so he started growing apple trees locally in 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="11">At first, the village called on Li Yuanzhong to convert his land to grow apple trees, but the Lis thought to themselves, “We’ve been growing apples for years and nobody in this village got rich from it. “</seg>
        <seg id="12">“All the apples come from dwarf apple trees, the trees don’t grow too tall. “</seg>
        <seg id="13">What Li Yuanzhong didn’t expect was, new methods were be adopted to grow apples this time; irrigation pipelines were laid under each apple tree, so that water and fertilizer could reach directly to the roots; when harvesting apples in the fall, tractors could drive directly into the orchard and the apples could be reached from standing on ground.</seg>
        <seg id="14">At present, the apple base is seeing high yield in produce, and as Hou Jianwen expected, the apples are selling well, especially among consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As the apple industry expands, it brings new changes to Li Yuanzhong’s life, and though he still farms, he has new sources of income.</seg>
        <seg id="16">As Li Yuanzhong transferred over 9 mu of his land to the apple base, he can collect land transfer fees each year, he also receives dividends from the apples, and he and his wife work on the base, “80 yuan per day each, with work year round.”</seg>
        <seg id="17">Li Yuanzhong told the reporter he receives 2,800 yuan in dividends, and with the land transfer fees and work payments, his household annual income is over 80,000 yuan, “We’re better off and don’t need to worry about survival anymore.”</seg>
        <seg id="18">“We have achieved initial success, and our annual output value per mu of apple is over 15,000 yuan, which is 10 times that of corn. “</seg>
        <seg id="19">Chen Chao told the reporters, there are 20,000 mu of apples planted in Yina Township, with 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 people, among which are 2,952 people from 656 recorded poverty households; the over 6 million yuan a year issued as wages is a realization of not traveling far for work with the base at the doorstep.</seg>
        <seg id="20">With more income, Li Yuanzhong has started to realize his personal dreams.</seg>
        <seg id="21">During this Spring Festival, Li Yuanzhong bought a off-road vehicle, and now he drives to work, “We still have a dozen of mu of land, so when the apple base expands, I’ll transfer it all to them, so we’ll have even more income. “</seg>

        <seg id="2">2020-07-27 02:22:36 来源：重庆晨报 作者：于晓 责任编辑：于晓</seg>
        <seg id="3">志愿填报前 先弄懂啥是专业级差</seg>
        <seg id="4">每年填报高考志愿，都有学生或者家长因为对于志愿填报中涉及的名词不了解，进而影响志愿填报。</seg>
        <seg id="5">今年，北京交通大学、北京科技大学、北京邮电大学、北京林业大学、北京化工大学5所高校联合发布2020年招生政策，取消专业级差。</seg>
        <seg id="6">专业级差是什么意思，在志愿填报中有何重要意义？</seg>
        <seg id="7">专业分配规则有三种方式</seg>
        <seg id="8">专家提醒，填报志愿前，一定要详读心仪学校的《招生章程》，了解高校的录取规则，包括调档比例，专业分配规则等。</seg>
        <seg id="9">专业分配规则，是指高校调档之后，对于专业录取主要有专业优先、分数优先、专业级差三种方式。</seg>
        <seg id="10">高校具体使用哪一种方式，会在《招生章程》中明确。</seg>
        <seg id="11">但也有一些高校的录取原则是总分优先，专业之间没有级差。</seg>
        <seg id="12">就是说将录取范围内考生按照总分排队，当分数未达到第一专业志愿录取分数线时，则看是否达到了第二专业志愿录取分数线，以此类推直到录取到最后一个专业志愿，各专业志愿之间不设级差。</seg>
        <seg id="13">所谓“专业级差”，是院校在安排考生专业时，按招生章程中公布的一个或几个分数值，来确定选报不同专业志愿考生的录取专业，这种分数值就是“专业级差”。</seg>
        <seg id="14">也就是院校在录取考生第一专业志愿和非第一专业志愿时的分数差额，各专业志愿间级差分数，如3分、2分、1分等。</seg>
        <seg id="15">举例来说。</seg>
        <seg id="16">假设学生小明报考A高校，考了560分，其专业志愿分别为：计算机、国际贸易、自动化、机械工程、电子商务，A高校的专业录取实行专业级差的办法，级差分为2分、1分、1分、0分。</seg>
        <seg id="17">在进行专业分配时，如果小明的第一专业志愿符合专业录取要求且专业有计划余额，那么小明被录取到“计算机”专业；若计算机未被录取，则他的分数将会被减去2分，按558分的成绩同第一专业志愿报考“国际贸易”的考生排序，确定是否符合专业录取条件；倘若仍不能满足，分数再减去1分(即557分)进行第三专业志愿“自动化”的录取；若依旧不能满足，分数再被减去1分(即556分)进行第四专业的录取，后续专业如果仍不能满足其专业志愿，将不再减分，以此类推。</seg>
        <seg id="18">不同大学专业级差设置不同</seg>
        <seg id="19">随着平行志愿的普及，现在很多高校都已经取消了专业级差，但今年仍有部分高校还保留了这一方法，从各校公布的《招生章程》来看，今年主要有20多所大学设置了专业级差。</seg>
        <seg id="20">比如，四川农业大学、山东科技大学、黑龙江中医药大学、江苏科技大学、江西师范大学、成都医学院、东北电力大学、集美大学、南京医科大学、南京工业大学、宁夏大学、山东理工大学、中国民用航空飞行学院等。</seg>
        <seg id="21">在这些高校中，每所大学设置的专业级差都不一样。</seg>
        <seg id="22">有的高校在每个专业都设有级差，比如宁夏大学，档案已投到该校的考生，根据考生填报专业志愿的顺序依次递减1分后按分数排序录取。</seg>
        <seg id="23">而有的大学在不同的专业之间，设置了不同的专业级差。</seg>
        <seg id="24">比如集美大学，专业志愿级差总分值为4分，即第一专业志愿与其他专业志愿级差为3分，其他专业志愿间不设级差，视为平行志愿，其他专业志愿与调剂专业志愿间专业级差为1分。</seg>
        <seg id="25">填报志愿时，考生及家长一定要认真阅读所报学校的录取政策，看看有没有专业级差，级差的形式是怎么样的，在充分考虑分数的同时，还要合理分析拟选的学校和专业，如果院校在招生章程中明确采取分数级差方式进行录取，考生在选择专业时，要注意各专业之间的梯度，提高录取几率。</seg>

        <seg id="2">2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning News Story: Yu Xiao Editor: Yu Xiao</seg>
        <seg id="3">Understanding university major point deductions before choosing your preferred majors</seg>
        <seg id="4">Each year, when we fill out our preferred majors on the NCEE (National College Entrance Examination), there are always students and parents who don’t understand the terminology involved, which can directly affect how you select your preferred majors.</seg>
        <seg id="5">This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology issued a joint admissions policy for 2020 which eliminates major point deductions.</seg>
        <seg id="6">What are “major point deductions”, and how do they impact your choice of major?</seg>
        <seg id="7">The three methods of major allocation</seg>
        <seg id="8">Experts say that before filling out your preferred majors, you should carefully read the school’s “Admissions Guidelines” to learn about the college’s admissions regulations, including enrollment ratios, major allocation, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Major allocation refers to the three primary methods of admitting students to particular majors, which are major priority, score priority, and major point deductions, after a student enrolls at a university.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The specific method used by a particular university will be stated clearly in the “Admissions Guidelines”.</seg>
        <seg id="11">However, some universities use balanced prioritization, and do not apply point deductions for different majors.</seg>
        <seg id="12">This means that all students who qualify for enrollment are ordered by a balanced total score, and if their score falls below enrollment requirements for their first preferred major, the university looks at whether the student qualifies for the second preferred major, and so on until the student’s final preferred major, none of which involves point deductions for any major.</seg>
        <seg id="13">“Major point deductions”, as they are called, are when universities apply one or several values calculated through a formula published in the “Admission Guidelines” to determine a student’s admission in a particular selected major; this value is called a “major point deductions”.</seg>
        <seg id="14">This refers to the point deduction that occurs between the student’s preferred major and another major, expressed by a point value, such as 3 points, 2 points, or 1 point.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Consider this example:</seg>
        <seg id="16">Xiaoming, a student, applies to University A with an NCEE score of 560 and major preferences listed in this order: Computing, International Trade, Automation, Mechanical Engineering, and E-commerce, after which University A applies major point deductions of 2, 1, 1, and 0 points.</seg>
        <seg id="17">When allocating majors, if Xiaoming meets the admission requirements for his first preferred major of Computing and the major has remaining vacancies, he is admitted to the Computing major; if he is not admitted to the Computing major, he is considered for his second preferred major of International Trade with 2 points deducted from his NCEE score, at 558, and his qualifications are considered for that major; if he again fails to qualify, 1 point is deducted (for a total of 557), and he is considered for his third preferred major; if he further fails to qualify, 1 more point is deducted (for a total of 556), and his qualifications are considered for his fourth preferred major, and if he fails to qualify this time, no points are deducted when he is considered for his fifth preferred major, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Different universities have different point deductions</seg>
        <seg id="19">As balanced major preferences become more popular, many universities have already stopped using major point deductions, but some universities still use this method, and from the “Admissions Guidelines” published by each school, we know that this year, major point deductions are applied at over 20 universities.</seg>
        <seg id="20">These include Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Tech University, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, and Civil Aviation Flight University of China.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The major point deduction values applied at each of these universities are different.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Some apply the same point deductions to every major, such as Ningxia University, where an applicant can expect to find 1 point deducted for each major in the order of major preference.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Other universities use different fixed point values for different universities.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Jimei University, for example, applies a total deduction of 4 points, meaning there is a difference of 3 points between a student’s first preferred major and other preferred majors, among preferred majors after the first there is no further deduction by preference (meaning they receive equal deductions), and there is a 1 point difference between preferred majors after the first and non-preferred majors.</seg>
        <seg id="25">When reporting major preferences, students and parents must be sure to carefully read the university’s admissions policies to see if there are major point deductions, and while considering the point values, must also carefully consider their universities and majors of choice; if the university lists clear major point deductions in the Admission Guidelines, they should pay close attention to the point tiers of different majors so they can maximize their chances of admission.</seg>

        <seg id="3">On Saturday, the badge of the U.S. Consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark-glass car drove away amid boos from passers-by.</seg>
        <seg id="4">On Sunday, many people in Chengdu gathered in front of the U.S. Consulate to take photos, and even those who had never visited the consulate came to have a look, motivated by curiosity about current events.</seg>
        <seg id="5">AFP's Chengdu reporter also visited the US consulate in Chengdu and reported that curious people were coming in droves, as well as many parents with their children walking to see the consulate and taking pictures of the building or taking selfies.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Guards swarmed around the consulate, and the police occasionally “corrected” people's behavior, seeming not to allow any transgressions: a woman was stopped just as she started singing a revolutionary song, and a guard confiscated a banner.</seg>
        <seg id="7">But residents of a nearby residential building managed to hang a giant Chinese flag on the balcony and shout pro-China slogans.</seg>

        <seg id="3">A bustling scene unfolds before your eyes as you walk into the electronics component processing poverty alleviation workshop on Tongdu Street in Dongchuan District.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Lu Ling, now in her 40’s, is a single mother who supports her child and her elderly parents by herself.</seg>
        <seg id="5">When things were at their most difficult for her, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped her find solutions and provided all kinds of aid that was like “a glass of water in the desert”.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Since 2018, she has enjoyed housing, school, social insurance, and employment assistance from policies and assistance funding from trade unions at every level.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This year, her child graduated and found a job, and she herself found a job and gained an income after receiving vocational training, which finally helped her escape her difficult situation in late April.</seg>
        <seg id="8">According to reports, the Special Poverty Alleviation Vocational Skills Training Program organized by the Dongchuan District Party Committee is part of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions skills training work.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Based on the unique characteristics of poverty alleviation for the recently relocated employment-challenged in the district, the District Committee has conducted in-depth investigations to understand training requirements and determine the types of vocational training to be conducted, and in the near future plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, and pastry chefs.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Li Yi, an employee at the Agricultural Bank’s Yunnan Menglian County Branch, recently wrote a heartfelt letter of thanks to the County Federation of Trade Unions.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In her letter, she offered sincere thanks for the Golden Autumn Scholarship she received from the trade union from August 2013 to January 2017, which allowed her to complete her studies.</seg>
        <seg id="12">After Li Yi’s father passed away in a car accident in 2004, her mother received employment-challenged status, and has enjoyed the benefits of inclusion in the system since.</seg>
        <seg id="13">With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Since 2016, systemic guarantees and targeted assistance have lifted 3,809 households out of poverty.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The successful poverty relief offered to Lv Ling’s family and Li Yi are a window into the poverty alleviation efforts for the employment-challenged of Yunnan’s trade unions.</seg>
        <seg id="16">According to Duan Kaiyuan, who works at the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions in the Legal and Rights Protection Work Department, the Federation’s provincial headquarters has enhanced its dynamic management of the employment-challenged filing system, pushed normalize filing for assistance, and worked to actively bring those qualified for employment-challenged status into assistance systems; they have also expanded channels to apply for employment-challenged status by creating a WeChat application platform to make it easier for the employment-challenged to seek and apply for assistance on their own.</seg>
        <seg id="17">During the epidemic, seeking work outside the home has been difficult, so to help alleviate pressure on the livelihoods of the employment-challenged, the Yunnan Province Central Party Committee has arranged a total of 13 million yuan in “Delivering Comfort” aid, providing 2,000 yuan to every household in the national employment-challenged database and 1,500 yuan to every household in the provincial employment-challenged database, aid that reached a total of 6,000 employment-challenged households nationally and 1,000 employment-challenged households in the province through the special program.</seg>
        <seg id="18">At the same time, the Yunnan Province Central Party Committee, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, zhaopin.com, and other online job recruitment sites worked together to push job recruitment information to the employment-challenged, provide employment consulting and guidance, and provide other services.</seg>
